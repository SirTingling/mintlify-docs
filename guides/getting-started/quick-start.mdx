## Common questions at this stage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long until my transactions appear?">
    Initial bank sync takes 1-4 hours depending on your bank. After that, new transactions typically appear within a few hours. Some banks are faster than others.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I have existing data in another system?">
    We can import from QuickBooks, Xero, and Wave. Go to **Settings → Integrations** to connect and import. For other systems, you can import transactions via CSV.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I undo formation if I change my mind?">
    Once we've filed with the state, formation can't be undone. But you can dissolve the company later if needed. Before filing, you can cancel at any point.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to enter historical transactions?">
    Not necessarily. You can start fresh from today. If you want historical data for reporting, you can:
    - Import from another accounting system
    - Upload bank statements as CSV
    - Enter opening balances as of a specific date
  </Accordion>
