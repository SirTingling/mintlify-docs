You have an account. Now you need a company in it.

Starting from scratch? We'll form your LLC or Corporation — file with the state, get your EIN, set up your registered agent. Already have a business? Connect it and start using Pluvel immediately.

## Option 1: Form a new company

If you're starting a new business, Pluvel handles formation end-to-end.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your entity type">
    Select the type of business you're forming:

    | Entity | Best for | Tax treatment |
    |--------|----------|---------------|
    | **LLC** | Most small businesses | Pass-through (profits taxed on your personal return) |
    | **Corporation** | Raising investment, going public eventually | Corporate tax, then dividends taxed again |
    | **S-Corp** | Saving on self-employment tax | Pass-through with salary requirements |
    | **Nonprofit** | Charitable organizations | Tax-exempt (with IRS approval) |

    <Info>
    Not sure? LLC is the most common choice for new businesses. It's flexible, protects your personal assets, and is simpler than a corporation.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose your state">
    Where you form matters. Common choices:

    - **Your home state** — Simplest option if you're operating locally
    - **Delaware** — Popular for corporations, especially if raising investment
    - **Wyoming** — Low fees, strong privacy protections, good for LLCs

    If you form in a different state than where you operate, you'll need to register as a "foreign" entity in your operating state (extra fees and filings).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter company details">
    Provide:

    - **Company name** — We check availability in your chosen state
    - **Business address** — Can be your home address or our registered agent address
    - **Business purpose** — General description (e.g., "software development" or "consulting services")
    - **Owners/members** — Names and ownership percentages
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up registered agent">
    Every company needs a registered agent — someone who can receive legal documents on the company's behalf. Pluvel includes registered agent service in all plans.

    We'll receive:
    - Legal notices
    - State correspondence
    - Tax documents

    Everything gets scanned and appears in your [Digital Mailroom](/features/mailroom/how-it-works).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and pay">
    Review your order:

    - **Pluvel fee** — Included in your subscription
    - **State filing fee** — Varies by state ($50-$500)
    - **Expedited processing** — Optional, faster turnaround

    Pay with card. We file within 1 business day.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for approval">
    Filing times vary by state:

    | State | Standard | Expedited |
    |-------|----------|-----------|
    | Delaware | 3-5 days | 24 hours |
    | Wyoming | 1-2 days | Same day |
    | California | 5-7 days | 3 days |
    | Texas | 3-5 days | 1 day |
    | New York | 5-7 days | 2 days |

    You'll get an email when your company is approved. Formation documents appear in your account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### After formation

Once approved, you'll want to:

1. **Get your EIN** — [File for an EIN](/guides/formation/get-ein) from the IRS (free, takes 5 minutes online)
2. **File your BOI report** — [Required within 90 days](/guides/formation/boi-report) for most companies
3. **Open a business bank account** — Use your formation documents and EIN
4. **Connect your bank to Pluvel** — Start tracking transactions

## Option 2: Connect an existing business

Already have a company? Add it to Pluvel and start using the platform immediately.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter company information">
    Provide:

    - **Legal name** — Exactly as registered with the state
    - **Entity type** — LLC, Corporation, etc.
    - **State of formation** — Where the company was originally formed
    - **EIN** — Your federal tax ID (if you have one)
    - **Formation date** — When the company was formed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify ownership">
    Confirm you're authorized to manage this company's finances. We may ask for documentation for certain features (like payroll).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your bank">
    Link your business bank accounts through Plaid. This pulls in your transactions so you can start categorizing and reconciling.

    [Connect your bank →](/guides/money/connect-bank)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import existing data (optional)">
    If you're switching from another accounting system:

    - **QuickBooks** — [Connect and import](/integrations/quickbooks)
    - **Xero** — [Connect and import](/integrations/xero)
    - **Wave** — [Import via CSV](/integrations/wave)
    - **Spreadsheets** — Upload transactions as CSV

    You can also start fresh and only track going forward.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Transferring registered agent

If you want Pluvel to be your registered agent (to use the Digital Mailroom), you can transfer from your current agent:

1. Go to **Settings → Compliance → Registered Agent**
2. Click **Transfer to Pluvel**
3. We file the change with your state (usually $25-50 state fee)
4. Takes 1-2 weeks to process

Your old agent will forward any mail received during the transition.
