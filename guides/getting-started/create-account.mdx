Before you can do anything useful, you need an account. This takes about 2 minutes and requires only an email address and a password.

## Sign up

  <Step title="Go to pluvel.com">
    Click **Get Started** or **Sign Up** in the top navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your details">
    Provide your name, email address, and create a password. You can also sign up with Google if you prefer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your email">
    We'll send a verification link to your email. Click it to confirm your account. Check your spam folder if you don't see it within a few minutes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You're in">
    After verification, you'll be taken to your dashboard. From here, you can add your first company.

## Choosing a password

Your password must be at least 8 characters. We recommend using a password manager to generate a strong, unique password.

<Warning>
Don't reuse passwords from other services. If another service gets breached and you've reused that password, your Pluvel account could be compromised.
</Warning>

## Two-factor authentication

After creating your account, we strongly recommend enabling two-factor authentication (2FA):

1. Go to **Settings → Security**
2. Click **Enable 2FA**
3. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.)
4. Enter the 6-digit code to confirm

<Tip>
Save your backup codes somewhere safe. If you lose access to your authenticator app, you'll need these to get back into your account.
</Tip>

## Multiple users

Each person who needs access to Pluvel should create their own account. After you set up a company, you can invite team members with different permission levels:

- **Owner** — Full access to everything, including billing
- **Admin** — Full access except billing and ownership transfer
- **Member** — Access to day-to-day features, no settings changes
- **Viewer** — Read-only access to reports and data

See [Team members & permissions](/features/company/team-members) for details.

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="I didn't receive the verification email">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The verification link expired">
    Verification links expire after 24 hours. Go to the sign-in page, enter your email and password, and we'll send a new verification link.

    Click "Forgot password" on the sign-in page. We'll send a reset link to your email. Reset links expire after 1 hour.
