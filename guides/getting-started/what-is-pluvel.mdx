description: The all-in-one platform for forming, running, and managing your business.

Pluvel handles the operational side of running a business — formation, compliance, banking, bookkeeping, invoicing, payroll, and taxes — in one place.

Instead of juggling LegalZoom for formation, a registered agent service, QuickBooks for accounting, Gusto for payroll, and a dozen browser tabs for compliance deadlines, you use Pluvel.

## What you can do

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Form your business">
    LLC, Corporation, S-Corp, or Nonprofit. We file with the state, get your EIN, and set up your registered agent. Formation takes 1-3 business days depending on your state.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stay compliant">
    Annual reports, BOI filings, business licenses, registered agent renewals — Pluvel tracks deadlines and reminds you before things are due. No more missed filings or late fees.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manage your money">
    Connect your bank accounts. Transactions sync automatically. Categorize expenses, reconcile accounts, and see where your money goes. Works with any bank through Plaid, plus direct integrations with Mercury.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Send invoices and track payments">
    Create invoices, send them to customers, and record payments when they come in. Set up recurring invoices for retainer clients. Get notified when invoices are overdue.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pay your team">
    Add employees and contractors. Run payroll, calculate taxes, generate pay stubs, and handle direct deposits. We file W-2s and 1099s at year-end.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle taxes">
    Sales tax collection and remittance. Payroll tax filings. Quarterly 941s. We integrate with TaxCloud for multi-state sales tax compliance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Get your mail">
    Your registered agent address receives official mail. We scan it, categorize it, and notify you when something needs attention. No more wondering if you missed an IRS notice.
  </Accordion>

## Who Pluvel is for

**Solopreneurs** who want to look professional without hiring an accountant. You can form your LLC, track income and expenses, send invoices, and file taxes — all from one dashboard.

**Small teams** who need payroll and expense tracking without enterprise complexity. Add employees, run payroll, and let us handle the tax filings.

**Agencies and consultants** who invoice clients and manage contractors. Create recurring invoices, track time, and generate 1099s at year-end.

**E-commerce sellers** dealing with multi-state sales tax. We integrate with TaxCloud to calculate, collect, and remit sales tax automatically.

**Accountants and bookkeepers** managing multiple clients. [Firm Mode](/accountants/overview) lets you see all your clients in one dashboard, switch between them instantly, and handle bookkeeping workflows efficiently.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Sign up with your email. Takes about 2 minutes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your company">
    Either form a new company (LLC, Corp, etc.) or connect an existing business. If you're forming new, we handle the state filing and EIN.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your bank">
    Link your bank accounts through Plaid. Transactions sync automatically — typically within a few hours for the initial import.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start using features">
    Invoicing, bills, payroll, reports — use what you need. You don't have to use everything. Start with what matters now; add more later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Pluvel doesn't do

We believe in being upfront about limitations:

- **Tax preparation** — We track your finances and generate reports, but we don't prepare your annual tax returns. Export your data to your accountant or tax software.
- **Full-service HR** — We handle payroll and contractor payments, but not benefits administration, performance reviews, or HR compliance beyond payroll tax filings.
- **Inventory management** — Basic product tracking for invoicing, but not warehouse management or manufacturing.
- **Point of sale** — We integrate with Shopify and Stripe, but we're not a POS system.
