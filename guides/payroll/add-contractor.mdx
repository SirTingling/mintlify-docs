description: Set up contractors and vendors for 1099 payments.
---

You hired a designer, developer, consultant, or freelancer. They're not an employee — they control their own hours, use their own equipment, and handle their own taxes. That makes them a contractor.

The key difference: you don't withhold taxes from their payments. But you do need their W-9, and if you pay them $600 or more in a year, you'll issue a 1099 at year-end.

## Contractor vs Employee

| Factor | Employee | Contractor |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Tax withholding | You withhold taxes | They pay their own |
| Tax forms | W-2 | 1099-NEC |
| Benefits | Often provided | Not provided |
| Control | You direct how work is done | They decide how |
| Equipment | Usually you provide | Usually they provide |

<Warning>
Misclassifying employees as contractors can result in IRS penalties, back taxes, and legal issues. When in doubt, consult with an attorney or accountant.
</Warning>

## What you need from contractors

Before paying a contractor, collect:

- **Form W-9** — Their tax ID (SSN or EIN) and business information
- **Payment details** — How they want to be paid
- **Contract** (recommended) — Scope of work, rates, terms

## 1099 filing

At year-end, Pluvel generates 1099-NEC forms for contractors who received $600+ during the year.

**Timeline:**
- January — Review contractor data for accuracy
- January 31 — 1099s must be sent to contractors
- January 31 — 1099s must be filed with the IRS

<Info>
Pluvel handles 1099 generation, contractor delivery, and IRS e-filing. You just review and approve.

## W-9 compliance

Track W-9 status for all contractors:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Complete | W-9 on file, tax ID verified |
| Pending | Requested but not received |
| Missing | Not yet requested |
| Expired | Information may need updating |

Don't pay contractors without a W-9 — you'll need it for 1099 filing.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I withhold taxes from contractor payments?">
    Generally no. Contractors handle their own taxes. The exception is backup withholding (24%) if they haven't provided a valid TIN.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When do I need to issue a 1099?">
    Issue a 1099-NEC if you paid a contractor $600 or more during the calendar year for services. This doesn't apply to payments made to corporations (except attorneys).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I pay contractors more frequently than employees?">
    Yes. Pay contractors whenever invoiced — there's no set schedule. Many businesses pay contractors within 15-30 days of invoice.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if a contractor refuses to provide a W-9?">
    You're required to report payments over $600. Without a W-9, you may need to apply backup withholding (24%) and report with "Applied For" as the TIN.
