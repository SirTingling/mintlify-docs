Payroll taxes are confusing. Employee-paid vs employer-paid. FICA vs FUTA vs SUTA. Quarterly filings, annual filings, deposit schedules. Miss a deadline or make a math error? Penalties add up fast.

Here's what you need to know: Pluvel calculates all of this automatically, withholds the right amounts, makes the deposits, and files the returns. But it helps to understand what's happening behind the scenes.

## Types of payroll taxes

### Employee withholdings

Amounts withheld from employee paychecks:

| Tax | Rate | Limit | Who pays |
|-----|------|-------|----------|
| Federal Income Tax | Varies by W-4 | None | Employee |
| Social Security | 6.2% | $168,600 (2024) | Employee |
| Medicare | 1.45% | None | Employee |
| Additional Medicare | 0.9% | Over $200,000 | Employee |
| State Income Tax | Varies by state | Varies | Employee |
| Local Tax | Varies | Varies | Employee (some areas) |

### Employer taxes

What you pay as the employer (not deducted from employee pay):

| Tax | Rate | Limit |
|-----|------|-------|
| Social Security | 6.2% | $168,600 (2024) |
| Medicare | 1.45% | None |
| FUTA (Federal Unemployment) | 0.6% | $7,000 |
| SUTA (State Unemployment) | Varies | Varies |

## How Pluvel handles taxes

### Calculation

When you run payroll, Pluvel automatically:
1. Calculates federal income tax based on W-4
2. Calculates FICA (Social Security + Medicare)
3. Calculates state and local taxes
4. Calculates employer taxes

### Withholding

Taxes are withheld from employee paychecks and set aside. You see these amounts on the payroll summary.

### Deposits

We deposit taxes with the IRS and state agencies:
- **Federal taxes** — Deposited per IRS schedule (semi-weekly or monthly)
- **State taxes** — Deposited per state requirements

### Filing

Pluvel files required tax returns:

| Form | Frequency | What it reports |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 941 | Quarterly | Federal income tax, Social Security, Medicare |
| 940 | Annual | FUTA (federal unemployment) |
| State forms | Varies | State withholding, unemployment |
| W-2 | Annual | Employee wages and taxes |

## Federal tax deposits

The IRS determines your deposit schedule based on tax liability:

| Total taxes owed | Deposit schedule |
|------------------|------------------|
| Less than $50,000/year | Monthly |
| $50,000+/year | Semi-weekly |
| Less than $2,500/quarter | With quarterly return |

Pluvel tracks your schedule and makes deposits on time.

## Quarterly Form 941

Every quarter, Pluvel files Form 941 reporting:
- Total wages paid
- Federal income tax withheld
- Social Security and Medicare taxes
- Deposits made

**Deadlines:**
| Quarter | Due date |
|---------|----------|
| Q1 (Jan-Mar) | April 30 |
| Q2 (Apr-Jun) | July 31 |
| Q3 (Jul-Sep) | October 31 |
| Q4 (Oct-Dec) | January 31 |

## Annual Form 940

Form 940 reports federal unemployment tax (FUTA):
- Due January 31
- Only on first $7,000 of each employee's wages
- You may get a credit for state unemployment taxes paid

## State payroll taxes

Each state has its own requirements:
