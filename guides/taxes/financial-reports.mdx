Your accountant asks for a P&L. Your bank wants a balance sheet. An investor requests cash flow data. If you don't know what these reports show — or can't produce them quickly — it's a problem.

Pluvel generates these reports automatically from your transaction data. No manual spreadsheets, no guessing. When someone asks for your financials, you have them.

## Core financial reports

### Profit & Loss (Income Statement)

Shows revenue minus expenses over a period.

**What it tells you:**
- Are you profitable?
- Where does money come from?
- Where does money go?

**Key sections:**
- **Revenue** — Money earned from sales and services
- **Cost of Goods Sold** — Direct costs of producing goods
- **Gross Profit** — Revenue minus COGS
- **Operating Expenses** — Overhead costs
- **Net Income** — Bottom line (profit or loss)

### Balance Sheet

Shows what you own, what you owe, and your equity at a specific point in time.

**What it tells you:**
- Company's financial position
- Available cash and assets
- Outstanding debts
- Owner's stake

**Key sections:**
- **Assets** — Cash, receivables, equipment, inventory
- **Liabilities** — Payables, loans, credit cards
- **Equity** — Owner's investment plus retained earnings

**The equation:** Assets = Liabilities + Equity

### Cash Flow Statement

Shows how cash moved in and out of the business.

**What it tells you:**
- Why cash changed
- Operating vs investing vs financing activities
- Future cash needs

**Key sections:**
- **Operating activities** — Cash from business operations
- **Investing activities** — Equipment purchases, asset sales
- **Financing activities** — Loans, owner contributions/draws

## Report accuracy

Your reports are only as accurate as your underlying data.

**For accurate reports:**
- Categorize all transactions
- Reconcile bank accounts regularly
- Record all invoices and bills
- Close out periods when complete

<Warning>
Uncategorized transactions appear in a suspense account and can distort your reports. Categorize everything.
</Warning>

## Sharing with your accountant

To share reports:

1. Export as PDF or Excel
2. Email to your accountant

Or invite your accountant to Pluvel:
1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Add them with Viewer or Admin access
3. They can run reports directly

## Report period comparison

Compare performance across periods:

1. Run a report
2. Click **Compare**
3. Select prior period (same month last year, prior quarter, etc.)
4. View side-by-side with variance

This helps you spot trends and anomalies.

## Using reports for taxes

Your accountant or tax software needs:

| Tax form | Reports needed |
|----------|----------------|
| Schedule C (Sole prop) | P&L by category |
| Form 1120 (C-Corp) | P&L, Balance Sheet |
| Form 1120S (S-Corp) | P&L, Balance Sheet |

Export reports for your tax year (January 1 - December 31 for calendar year).
