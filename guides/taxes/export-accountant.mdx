January arrives and your accountant sends the same email: "I need your P&L, balance sheet, payroll summary, and any 1099s you issued." Maybe they also ask about fixed assets, mileage, or specific receipts. The faster you get them clean data, the faster your taxes get filed — and the smaller your bill for their time.

Here's how to pull everything together from Pluvel.

## What accountants typically need

For annual tax returns, your accountant usually needs:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Profit & Loss statement | Income and expenses for the year |
| Balance Sheet | Assets, liabilities, equity |
| Bank statements | Verify transactions |
| Payroll summary | Wages, taxes, benefits |
| 1099 summary | Contractor payments |
| Fixed asset list | Depreciation calculations |
| Mileage/travel log | Deduction documentation |
| Receipts | Expense verification |

## Export financial reports

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Reports">
    Click **Reports** in the sidebar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run each report">
    For tax year (e.g., January 1 - December 31, 2025):
    - **Profit & Loss** — Full year
    - **Balance Sheet** — As of December 31
    - **Trial Balance** — As of December 31
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export as PDF or Excel">
    Click **Export** and choose format:
    - **PDF** — Easy to share
    - **Excel** — If they need to manipulate data
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Export transactions

For detailed review:

1. Go to **Reports → Transaction Report**
2. Set date range for tax year
3. Export as CSV or Excel

This gives your accountant every transaction with categories.

## Export payroll data

1. Go to **Payroll → Reports**
2. Run **Payroll Summary** for the tax year
3. Export as PDF or Excel

Includes:
- Total wages by employee
- Tax withholdings
- Employer taxes
- Benefits and deductions

## Give your accountant access

Instead of exporting, invite them to Pluvel:

1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter their email
4. Set role to **Viewer** (read-only) or **Admin**

They can then run reports themselves and get real-time data.

## Prepare supporting documents

Beyond reports, gather:

### Receipts and documentation
- Go to **Banking → Transactions**
- Filter for transactions without receipts
- Attach missing documentation
- Export with attachments if needed

### 1099s issued
- Go to **Payroll → Contractors → 1099s**
- Download the 1099 summary

### Fixed assets
- List equipment, vehicles, and property
- Include purchase dates and amounts
- Your accountant calculates depreciation

### Vehicle mileage
- If you deduct vehicle expenses
- Provide mileage log or tracking data

## Common questions from accountants

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is everything categorized?">
    Go to **Banking** and check for uncategorized transactions. Categorize everything before exporting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are the books closed for the year?">
    Ideally, don't make changes to prior-year transactions after giving data to your accountant. If you must, let them know.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the bank reconcile?">
    Your bank balance should match your Pluvel balance. Reconcile all accounts before year-end.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about owner's draws and contributions?">
    Make sure these are categorized correctly (not as income/expense). They affect the Balance Sheet, not P&L.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Timing

**When to share:**
- As early as possible in January
- After you've received all year-end documents (bank statements, 1099s you receive, etc.)

**Deadlines:**
| Entity type | Tax return due |
|-------------|----------------|
| S-Corp (1120S) | March 15 |
| Partnership (1065) | March 15 |
| C-Corp (1120) | April 15 |
| Individual (1040) | April 15 |

Extensions are available but require filing beforehand.

## Organizing files

When sending to your accountant, organize clearly:

```

├── Financial_Reports/
│   ├── Profit_Loss_2025.pdf
│   ├── Balance_Sheet_2025.pdf
