A vendor invoice sits in your email. You'll pay it later. Later turns into next week. Next week turns into "past due." Now there's a late fee, maybe an angry email, maybe your service gets shut off.

Tracking bills properly means knowing exactly what you owe, to whom, and when it's due — before "I'll pay that later" becomes "why didn't anyone tell me?"

    - **Due date** — When payment is due
    - **Amount** — Total owed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add line items">

## Tips for managing bills

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Process bills immediately">
    When a bill arrives, enter it right away. Set the due date so you don't forget. Waiting leads to missed payments and late fees.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use consistent vendor names">
    "Amazon" vs "Amazon.com" vs "AMAZON" creates confusion. Pick one name per vendor and stick to it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Attach the original document">
    Always upload the vendor's invoice. You'll need it for audits, disputes, or just remembering what you paid for.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review AP weekly">
    Check your Accounts Payable aging every week. Know what's coming due and plan your cash accordingly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Negotiate payment terms">
    If cash is tight, ask vendors for Net 30 or Net 45 instead of immediate payment. Many vendors offer terms to business customers.
