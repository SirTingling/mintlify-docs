Here's an uncomfortable truth: the longer an invoice sits unsent, the longer you wait to get paid. A freelancer who invoices the day the work is done gets paid 14 days faster on average than one who waits until "next week."

This guide shows you how to create and send invoices that actually get paid — quickly.

## The anatomy of an invoice that gets paid

Before we get into buttons, understand what makes invoices effective:

- **Clear due date** — "Net 30" means nothing to most people. "Due February 14" is unmistakable.
- **Specific line items** — "Consulting Services: $5,000" raises questions. "Website redesign - homepage and 3 landing pages: $5,000" doesn't.
- **Easy payment method** — A "Pay Now" button beats "mail a check to..." every time.
- **Your contact info** — So they can reach you if something's unclear (instead of just not paying).

## Create an invoice

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the invoice">
    Click **Invoicing** in the sidebar, then **Create Invoice**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick the customer">
    Select an existing customer or add a new one. For new customers, you need:
    - Customer name (company or individual)
    - Email address (where the invoice goes)
    - Billing address (for the invoice itself)

    Tip: Get the email right. Wrong email = invoice sitting in a spam folder = you not getting paid.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add what you're billing for">
    Each line item needs:
    - **Description** — Be specific. "Logo design - 3 concepts, 2 revision rounds" is better than "Design work."
    - **Quantity** — Hours, units, projects, whatever makes sense
    - **Rate** — Price per unit
    - **Amount** — Calculated automatically

    Add as many line items as needed. More detail usually means fewer questions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the terms">
    - **Invoice number** — Auto-generated, or customize if you have a system
    - **Invoice date** — Usually today
    - **Due date** — When you expect payment
    - **Payment terms** — Net 30, Due on Receipt, etc.

    Here's a secret: shorter payment terms work. Clients who'd pay in 30 days with Net 30 often pay in 15 days with Net 15. They don't even notice the difference.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add notes (optional)">
    - **Notes to customer** — Thank them, reference the project, add payment instructions
    - **Internal notes** — Only you see these. "Bob always pays late" is good to track.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview and send">
    Preview shows exactly what your customer receives. When ready:
    - **Send** — Emails immediately
    - **Save as draft** — Save for later
    - **Download PDF** — For your records or manual sending
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enable online payments (this is the big one)

Customers who can pay with a button pay faster than customers who have to mail checks. It's not close.

To enable online payments:

1. Go to **Settings → Payments**
2. Connect Stripe (or use Pluvel Payments)
3. Enable payment methods:
   - **Card** — Credit/debit cards (fastest, 2-3% fee)
   - **ACH** — Bank transfer (slower but cheaper, usually 0.8% capped at $5)

Once enabled, every invoice gets a "Pay Now" button. Customer clicks it, enters their card or bank info, done.

**The numbers:**
- Invoices with online payment: Average 11 days to payment
- Invoices without: Average 27+ days
- Checks that "got lost in the mail": Don't get us started

## Payment terms explained

| Term | What it means | When to use |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Due on Receipt | Pay now | Rush jobs, new clients you don't know yet |
| Net 15 | Due 15 days from invoice date | Recommended default for most businesses |
| Net 30 | Due 30 days from invoice date | Standard for larger clients |
| Net 60 | Due 60 days from invoice date | Enterprise clients who require it |
| Custom | Any number of days | When you negotiate something specific |

The default matters. Most people accept whatever terms you set. If you default to Net 30 when Net 15 would work, you're voluntarily waiting two extra weeks.

Set your default in **Settings → Invoice Settings**.

## Track where your money is

Every invoice has a status:

| Status | What it means | Your action |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Not sent yet | Finish and send it |
| **Sent** | Delivered to customer | Wait (but not too long) |
| **Viewed** | Customer opened it | They know. The clock's ticking. |
| **Partial** | Some payment received | Follow up on the rest |
| **Paid** | Fully paid | Celebrate |
| **Overdue** | Past due date, unpaid | Send reminder immediately |

The "Viewed" status is powerful. If an invoice was viewed a week ago but not paid, you know the customer saw it and chose not to act. Time to follow up.

## Record manual payments

When someone pays by check or wire:

1. Open the invoice
2. Click **Record Payment**
3. Enter:
   - Amount received
   - Payment date
   - Method (check, wire, cash)
   - Reference (check number, wire confirmation)
4. Save

The invoice updates to Paid (or Partial if not the full amount).

<Info>
Online payments through Stripe record automatically. You don't need to do anything.

## Send payment reminders

For overdue invoices (because they happen):

**Manual reminder:**
1. Open the overdue invoice
2. Click **Send Reminder**
3. Customize the message if you want
4. Send

**Automatic reminders:**
1. Go to **Settings → Invoice Settings → Reminders**
2. Turn on automatic reminders
3. Set timing:
   - 3 days before due (gentle nudge)
   - Day of (friendly reminder)
   - 7 days overdue (firmer tone)
   - 14 days overdue (getting serious)

The best reminder is the one you don't have to remember to send.

## Recurring invoices

If you bill the same amount to the same client regularly — retainers, subscriptions, monthly services — set it up once:

1. Go to **Invoicing → Recurring**
2. Click **Create Recurring Invoice**
3. Set up the template:
   - Customer
   - Line items
   - Frequency (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
   - Start date
   - End date (or leave ongoing)
4. Save

Pluvel creates and sends invoices automatically. You stop thinking about it.

## Duplicate an existing invoice

Similar job for the same client? Don't start from scratch:

1. Open a previous invoice
2. Click **Duplicate**
3. Update what changed (date, line items, amounts)
4. Send

## Void vs. delete

- **Void** — Cancels an invoice but keeps the record. Use this for invoices you already sent. The paper trail matters.
- **Delete** — Removes completely. Only available for drafts that were never sent.

Voided invoices don't affect revenue reports. They're just there for the audit trail.

## Getting paid faster: the checklist

1. **Invoice immediately.** Work done Friday? Invoice Friday. Not "sometime next week."
2. **Enable online payments.** Card or ACH. Make it easy.
3. **Use Net 15 instead of Net 30.** Most clients won't push back.
4. **Set up automatic reminders.** Awkward to send. Effective when automated.
5. **Be specific.** Detailed descriptions reduce back-and-forth questions that delay payment.
6. **Follow up on "Viewed" invoices.** They saw it. They haven't paid. That's your cue.
