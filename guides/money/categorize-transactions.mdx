A transaction without a category is just a number. Is that $127 from AWS an operating expense or a cost of goods sold? Is that $500 from "Smith, J." revenue or a loan repayment?

Categorization turns raw transactions into useful financial data. It's what makes your P&L accurate, your tax deductions legitimate, and your business insights meaningful.

## Why categorization matters

**Accurate reports** — Your Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and other reports depend on correct categorization.

**Tax deductions** — Expenses need proper categories for tax time. Office supplies vs. meals vs. equipment — each has different tax treatment.

**Business insights** — See where your money actually goes. Which categories eat up the most cash?

## Categorize a transaction

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Banking">
    Click **Banking** in the sidebar to see your transaction list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find uncategorized transactions">
    Uncategorized transactions are highlighted. You can filter to show only uncategorized items.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click on a transaction">
    Open the transaction detail panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a category">
    Choose from your chart of accounts. Common categories:

    **Income:**
    - Sales Revenue
    - Service Revenue
    - Interest Income

    **Expenses:**
    - Office Supplies
    - Software & Subscriptions
    - Professional Services
    - Meals & Entertainment
    - Travel
    - Advertising
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add details (optional)">
    - **Memo** — Notes about the transaction
    - **Vendor/Customer** — Link to a contact
    - **Receipt** — Attach documentation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save**. The transaction is now categorized.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bulk categorization

For multiple similar transactions:

1. Check the boxes next to transactions you want to categorize
2. Click **Bulk Actions** → **Categorize**
3. Select the category
4. All selected transactions are updated

This is useful for categorizing a month's worth of a recurring expense at once.

## Bank rules

Set up rules to automatically categorize recurring transactions:

1. Go to **Settings → Bank Rules** (or click **Create Rule** from a transaction)
2. Define the condition:
   - If description **contains** "AWS"
   - If amount **equals** $9.99
   - If vendor **is** "Spotify"
3. Define the action:
   - Categorize as "Software & Subscriptions"
   - Add vendor "Amazon Web Services"
4. Save the rule

New matching transactions are categorized automatically.

## Split transactions

Sometimes one transaction covers multiple categories. For example, an Amazon order with office supplies and cleaning supplies:

1. Open the transaction
2. Click **Split**
3. Add line items:
   - $45.00 → Office Supplies
   - $22.00 → Cleaning & Maintenance
4. Save

The transaction now appears correctly in both categories.

## Common categories

## Handling specific transaction types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transfers between accounts">
    When money moves between your own accounts (checking to savings), it's a transfer, not income or expense. Categorize as **Transfer** or use the **Match** feature to link both sides.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Owner's draws / contributions">
    Money you put into or take out of the business:
    - **Owner's Contribution** — Money you invest
    - **Owner's Draw** — Money you take out
    These affect your equity, not income/expenses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reimbursements">
    If you paid with a personal card and reimbursed yourself:
    1. Record the expense with the correct category
    2. Record the reimbursement as **Owner's Contribution** or offset the expense
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Refunds">
    Customer refund? Categorize as negative income (or a refund account).
    Expense refund? Categorize as negative expense.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Loan payments">
    Principal and interest are different:
    - **Principal** — Reduces your liability (not an expense)
    - **Interest** — Is an expense (Interest Expense category)

    Split the transaction if needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for efficiency

1. **Categorize regularly** — Daily or weekly is easier than monthly
2. **Use bank rules** — Set them up for recurring transactions
3. **Be consistent** — Use the same category for similar expenses
4. **When in doubt** — Check with your accountant or use a general category
5. **Attach receipts** — Makes tax time and audits easier
