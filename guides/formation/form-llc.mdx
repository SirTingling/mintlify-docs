You've got a business idea. Maybe you're already making money from it. But right now, if someone sues your business, they're also suing you. Your savings, your house, your car — all fair game.

An LLC creates a legal wall between your business and your personal life. It's the most popular structure for small businesses because it gives you protection without drowning you in paperwork.

## Why an LLC makes sense

**Your personal assets stay protected.** If your business gets sued or can't pay its debts, creditors can only go after business assets. Your personal savings and property are separate.

**Taxes stay simple.** LLC profits flow directly to your personal tax return — no corporate tax return, no double taxation. One less thing to deal with.

**Fewer formalities than a corporation.** No required board meetings, no annual shareholder meetings, no corporate minutes. Just run your business.

**Clients and banks take you seriously.** "Smith Consulting LLC" sounds more established than "John Smith, freelancer." That matters when you're closing deals or applying for business credit.

## What you'll need ready

Before starting, grab this information:

- **Company name** — We'll check availability in your state
- **Business address** — Your home address works, or use our registered agent address for privacy
- **Owner information** — Names, addresses, and ownership percentages for all members
- **Business purpose** — Keep it general ("consulting services", "software development") for flexibility

## Form your LLC

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start formation">
    From your dashboard, click **Add Company** → **Form a New Company** → **LLC**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose your state">
    Select where you want to form. Most people choose their home state — it's the simplest option.

    <Info>
    Forming in a different state than where you operate? You'll need to register as a "foreign LLC" in your operating state too. That means double the fees and double the annual reports.
    </Info>

    **Popular alternatives:**
    - **Wyoming** — $100 filing fee, strong privacy laws, no state income tax
    - **Delaware** — Business-friendly courts, but mainly beneficial for corporations seeking investors
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter company details">
    - **LLC name** — Must include "LLC" or "Limited Liability Company"
    - **Business address** — This becomes public record (use our registered agent address if you want privacy)
    - **Business purpose** — "Any lawful business" gives you maximum flexibility
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add members">
    List all owners with their:
    - Full legal name
    - Address
    - Ownership percentage

    Single-member LLC? You're the only member at 100%.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose management structure">
    - **Member-managed** — All owners run the business together (most common for small LLCs)
    - **Manager-managed** — Designated managers handle day-to-day operations (better when you have silent partners or investors)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up registered agent">
    Every LLC needs a registered agent — someone to receive legal documents on behalf of your business. Pluvel includes this service. We'll be your registered agent and forward everything to your [Digital Mailroom](/features/mailroom/how-it-works).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and pay">
    Review your information and pay:
    - **Pluvel fee** — Included in your subscription
    - **State filing fee** — Varies by state ($50-$500)
    - **Expedited processing** — Optional, if you need it faster
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After your LLC is approved

Once the state approves your filing, you've got a few more steps:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Get your EIN" icon="hashtag" href="/guides/formation/get-ein">
    Your federal tax ID. Takes 5 minutes online. You need this before opening a bank account.
  </Card>
  <Card title="File BOI report" icon="file-lines" href="/guides/formation/boi-report">
    Required within 90 days for most new companies. Penalties for missing this are steep.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open a bank account" icon="building-columns" href="/guides/money/connect-bank">
    Use your formation documents and EIN. Keep business money separate from personal.

## Operating agreement

An operating agreement spells out how your LLC works — ownership percentages, voting rights, profit distribution, what happens if a member leaves or wants to sell.

<Warning>
Not required in all states, but you absolutely should have one. Banks sometimes ask for it. And if there's ever a dispute between members, this document determines who wins.
</Warning>

Pluvel generates a basic operating agreement when you form. Review it, customize it, or have an attorney look it over if you have multiple members or complex arrangements.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I form an LLC by myself?">
    Yes. A single-member LLC has one owner. The IRS treats it as a "disregarded entity" — all profits go directly on your personal tax return (Schedule C). You get the liability protection without the tax complexity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does formation take?">
    Depends entirely on the state. Wyoming can be same-day with expedited processing. California can take a week or more. You'll receive an email the moment it's approved.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change my LLC name later?">
    Yes, but it requires filing an amendment with the state and paying another fee. Choose carefully the first time — it's cheaper than changing later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between LLC and sole proprietorship?">
    Liability protection. With a sole proprietorship, you and your business are legally the same person. If your business gets sued, your personal assets are at risk. An LLC creates a legal separation between the two.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I form in Delaware or Wyoming instead of my home state?">
    Probably not, unless you have a specific reason. If you form in Delaware but operate in California, you'll pay fees to both states and file reports in both. For most small businesses, forming in your home state is simpler and cheaper.
