description: Apply for a federal Employer Identification Number from the IRS.
---

You just formed your LLC or corporation. Before you can open a business bank account, hire anyone, or file taxes, you need one more thing: an EIN.

An EIN (Employer Identification Number) is a 9-digit tax ID from the IRS. Think of it as a Social Security number for your business. It takes about 5 minutes to get one, and it's completely free.

## Why you need an EIN

- **Open a business bank account** — Banks require an EIN. No exceptions.
- **Hire employees** — Needed for payroll tax reporting
- **File business taxes** — Goes on every tax return
- **Apply for business credit** — Credit applications ask for it
- **Work with clients** — Some clients need your EIN for their 1099 reporting

<Info>
Single-member LLCs without employees can technically use the owner's SSN for taxes. But getting an EIN is still smart — it keeps your personal Social Security number off business documents and invoices.

## When to apply

Apply after your company is formed and approved by the state. You'll need your formation documents (Articles of Organization or Incorporation) to answer the questions.

## Apply online — the fast way

The IRS website is the quickest method. It's free, and you get your EIN immediately.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I apply before my company is formed?">
    No. The IRS requires your company to legally exist before issuing an EIN. Wait until you receive confirmation that your state has approved your formation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my EIN the same as my state tax ID?">
    No. Your EIN is federal — it's for the IRS. State tax IDs (for sales tax, state income tax, etc.) are separate and come from your state's tax agency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I lose my EIN confirmation letter?">
    Call the IRS Business & Specialty Tax Line at (800) 829-4933. They can verify your EIN over the phone after asking security questions. You can also find it on previous tax returns or bank statements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need a new EIN if my business changes?">
    It depends:
    - **Name change only** — No, keep the same EIN
    - **New address** — No, keep the same EIN
    - **Convert LLC to corporation** — Yes, new EIN required
    - **Change in ownership structure** — Usually needs a new EIN
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have multiple EINs?">
    Each legal entity needs its own EIN. If you have three companies (even under the same ownership), you need three EINs.
  </Accordion>
