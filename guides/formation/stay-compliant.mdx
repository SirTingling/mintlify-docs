You formed your LLC or corporation. Congratulations — but the paperwork doesn't stop there.

Every state has ongoing requirements: annual reports, franchise taxes, license renewals. Miss these and you'll get hit with late fees. Ignore them long enough and the state can dissolve your company entirely. That liability protection you formed for? Gone.

Here's what you need to stay on top of, and how Pluvel keeps track of it for you.

## What you need to file

### Annual reports

Most states require an annual (or biennial) report confirming your company information is current. It's basically the state asking: "Are you still operating? Same address? Same owners?"

| What you report | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
| Registered agent | Confirm or update |
| Principal business address | Where you operate |
| Members or officers | Names and addresses |
| Business status | Confirm you're still active |

Filing fees range from $50-$400 depending on the state. Due dates vary — some states use your formation anniversary, others have fixed dates.

### Franchise taxes

Some states charge you just for the privilege of existing there. These aren't income taxes — you pay them regardless of profit.

| State | Tax | When due |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Delaware | Based on shares or assumed par value | March 1 |
| California | $800 minimum | April 15 |
| Texas | Based on revenue | May 15 |

Delaware's franchise tax catches people off guard. A corporation with 10 million authorized shares can owe $85,000+ if you use the wrong calculation method. (Use the Assumed Par Value method — it's almost always cheaper.)

### Registered agent renewal

Your registered agent service needs to stay active. If it lapses, you won't receive legal notices, and the state may not be able to contact you.

Pluvel handles this automatically — registered agent is included in your subscription and renews without you lifting a finger.

### Business licenses

Depending on your industry and location:
- State business license
- City or county business license
- Professional licenses (for regulated industries)
- Seller's permit (if you collect sales tax)

These vary wildly. A home-based consultant might need nothing beyond state registration. A restaurant needs health permits, liquor licenses, fire inspections, and more.

### BOI report updates

If beneficial ownership changes — new partners, ownership percentages shift, someone's address changes — file an updated BOI report within 30 days.

## How Pluvel helps

### Compliance calendar

See every deadline in one place:

1. Go to **Compliance** in your dashboard
2. View calendar or list format
3. Each item shows the deadline, fee, and current status

We pull deadlines from your state filings, registered agent, and any licenses you've told us about.

### Automatic reminders

You'll get reminders before deadlines hit:
- 30 days before
- 14 days before
- 7 days before
- Day of (if still not completed)

Configure notification preferences in **Settings → Notifications**.

### File directly from Pluvel

For supported filings (annual reports in most states), you can file without leaving Pluvel:

1. Click the deadline
2. Review the pre-filled information
3. Pay the state fee
4. We submit on your behalf and store the confirmation

## What happens if you miss a deadline

### Late fees

Most states charge late fees that compound over time. Delaware's franchise tax adds 1.5% per month plus a $200 penalty. California hits you with $250 for late annual reports.

### Loss of good standing

After enough missed filings, you lose "good standing" status. This matters because:
- Banks may freeze your account or refuse new accounts
- You can't get a Certificate of Good Standing (required for many contracts and loans)
- Some states won't let you file lawsuits in their courts

### Administrative dissolution

Ignore filings long enough (usually 1-2 years) and the state will dissolve your company. This means:
- You lose liability protection
- You can't legally operate the business
- Contracts may be unenforceable
- Reinstating costs more than staying compliant ever would

### Reinstatement

If you do get dissolved, you can usually reinstate by:
1. Filing all missed reports
2. Paying all back fees and penalties
3. Filing a reinstatement form
4. Waiting for state approval

It's expensive and time-consuming. Prevention is much cheaper.

## State-specific requirements

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Delaware">
    - **Annual franchise tax:** Due March 1
    - **Annual report:** Filed with franchise tax
    - **Fee:** Minimum $225 for LLCs, $225+ for corporations (based on structure)

    Delaware uses two methods to calculate corporate franchise tax. Always calculate both and use whichever is lower.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="California">
    - **Statement of Information:** Due within 90 days of formation, then every 2 years (LLCs) or annually (corps)
    - **Franchise tax:** $800 minimum, due April 15
    - **LLC fee:** Additional fee if revenue exceeds $250,000

    California charges the $800 even if you formed elsewhere but "do business" in California.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Wyoming">
    - **Annual report:** Due in your anniversary month
    - **Fee:** $60 (or $60 per $250,000 in assets if higher)
    - **No franchise tax**

    Wyoming is one of the cheapest states for ongoing compliance.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Texas">
    - **Franchise tax:** Due May 15 (based on revenue)
    - **Threshold:** No tax if revenue under $2.47M
    - **Report:** Public Information Report filed with tax

    Most small businesses in Texas owe $0 in franchise tax — you still have to file the report, though.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep your registered agent current">
    If you move or change registered agents, file the change with the state immediately. Missing legal notices because they went to an old address can have serious consequences — lawsuits can proceed without you even knowing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Separate business and personal finances">
    Always use your business bank account for business expenses. Mixing funds can jeopardize your liability protection. Courts call it "piercing the corporate veil" when they decide your LLC or corporation doesn't deserve liability protection because you didn't treat it as a separate entity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep meeting minutes (corporations)">
    For corporations especially, document major decisions. Hold annual meetings (even if it's just you talking to yourself) and keep records. This paper trail protects your liability shield.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update ownership promptly">
    When ownership changes, update your operating agreement (LLCs) or stock records (corporations). File any required state notices. And file an updated BOI report within 30 days.
