description: Form a Limited Liability Company through Pluvel.
---

You want liability protection without the headache of running a corporation. No board meetings. No annual shareholder votes. No corporate minutes to file. Just a legal structure that keeps your personal assets separate from your business.

That's an LLC. It's the most popular business structure in America, and there's a reason: it works for almost everyone.

## Why people choose LLCs

**Your house, your savings, your car — protected.** If your business gets sued or can't pay its debts, creditors can only go after business assets. They can't touch what's yours personally.

**One tax return, not two.** LLC profits flow directly to your personal tax return. No corporate tax filing. No double taxation. (You can elect corporate taxation later if it makes sense.)

**Banks and clients take you more seriously.** "Smith Consulting LLC" gets better treatment than "John Smith, freelancer." That perception matters when you're opening accounts, signing contracts, or pitching bigger clients.

**Minimal paperwork.** Unlike corporations, most states don't require annual meetings, shareholder votes, or corporate minutes. Run your business, not a bureaucracy.

## What Pluvel handles

When you form an LLC through Pluvel:

| Task | What we do |
|------|------------|
| Name availability | Check if your name is available in your state |
| Articles of Organization | File with the Secretary of State |
| Registered agent | Provide a registered agent in your state (included) |
| EIN application | Apply for your federal tax ID |
| Operating Agreement | Generate a template you can customize |
| State compliance | Track annual report deadlines automatically |

## How long formation takes

| State type | Typical timeline |
|------------|------------------|
| Fast states (Wyoming, Delaware) | 1-2 business days |
| Average states | 3-5 business days |
| Slow states (California, New York) | 5-10 business days |

<Info>
Expedited filing is available in most states for an additional fee. We'll show you the options during checkout.

## Choosing where to form

Most businesses should form in their home state — where they have a physical presence or do most of their business. It's simpler and cheaper.

### When another state makes sense

- **Holding companies** that own assets but don't actively operate
- **Venture-backed startups** (investors often prefer Delaware, though that's more common for corporations)
- **Privacy-focused businesses** (Wyoming doesn't require member names in public filings)
- **Multi-state businesses** with no clear home base

<Warning>
Form in a different state than where you operate, and you'll need to "foreign qualify" in your home state too. That means double the compliance requirements and double the fees every year.
</Warning>

## Single-member vs. multi-member

| Type | Who it's for | Tax treatment |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Single-member | One owner | Disregarded entity — profits go on your Schedule C |
| Multi-member | Two or more owners | Partnership — you'll file Form 1065 |

Pluvel supports both. During formation, you'll specify how many members your LLC has and their ownership percentages.

## What you need to form

<Steps>
  <Step title="Business name">
    Your desired LLC name. We'll check availability. Most states require "LLC" or "Limited Liability Company" in the name.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Business address">
    Where your business operates. This becomes public record. You can use your registered agent address if you want to keep your home address private.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Member information">
    Names and addresses of all members (owners). Some states require this in the public filing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Management structure">
    Member-managed (owners run the business) or manager-managed (designated managers run it). Most small LLCs are member-managed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After formation

Once your LLC is approved:

1. **EIN** — We apply for your federal tax ID (usually same day)
2. **Operating Agreement** — Download your template and customize it
3. **Compliance calendar** — Annual reports and renewals are tracked automatically
4. **Banking** — Open a business bank account with your formation documents

## State-specific gotchas

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="California">
    California charges an $800 annual franchise tax regardless of profit. Due the first year and every year after. This applies even if you formed in another state but do business in California.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="New York">
    New York requires LLCs to publish formation notices in two newspapers for six consecutive weeks. Cost: $300-$1,500 depending on the county. Pluvel handles this for you, but budget for it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Texas">
    No state income tax. No annual report — you file a "Public Information Report" with your franchise tax return instead. Franchise tax is often $0 for small businesses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Florida">
    Annual report due May 1st each year. $138.75 filing fee. We remind you 60 days before.
  </Accordion>
