description: Form a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization through Pluvel.
---

You want to start something that matters — a charity, an educational program, a community organization. But you've heard the process is complicated. Multiple filings. IRS applications. Boards and bylaws and bureaucracy.

Here's the reality: forming a nonprofit takes more steps than forming an LLC, but it's not as scary as it sounds. You file with your state, then apply to the IRS for tax-exempt status. If you've got a clear mission and organized records, you'll get there.

## Why form a nonprofit

**Tax exemption.** No federal income tax on revenue related to your mission. Some states also exempt property and sales tax.

**Donor deductions.** Contributions to 501(c)(3) organizations are tax-deductible. That makes fundraising dramatically easier — donors have a financial incentive to give.

**Grant eligibility.** Most foundations and government grants require 501(c)(3) status. Without it, you're locked out of major funding sources.

**Credibility.** Formal nonprofit status signals accountability and legitimacy. Donors trust organizations with IRS recognition.

## Two steps to tax-exempt status

Forming a nonprofit requires two separate approvals:

<Steps>
  <Step title="State incorporation">
    File Articles of Incorporation with your state as a nonprofit corporation. This creates the legal entity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="IRS 501(c)(3) application">
    File Form 1023 or 1023-EZ with the IRS to get tax-exempt status. This is the federal recognition that makes donations deductible.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
State incorporation alone doesn't make you tax-exempt. You must also receive IRS determination. Until then, donations aren't tax-deductible.
</Warning>

## What Pluvel handles

| Task | What we do |
|------|------------|
| Name availability | Check if your name is available |
| Articles of Incorporation | File nonprofit articles with your state |
| Registered agent | Provide a registered agent (included) |
| EIN application | Apply for your federal tax ID |
| Bylaws | Generate nonprofit bylaws template |
| Conflict of interest policy | Required for 501(c)(3) applications |
| Form 1023 or 1023-EZ | Prepare and file your tax-exempt application |

## 501(c)(3) requirements

To qualify, your organization must:

**Operate exclusively for exempt purposes:**
- Charitable
- Religious
- Educational
- Scientific
- Literary
- Prevention of cruelty to children or animals
- Public safety testing

**Not benefit private individuals.** No part of earnings can benefit private shareholders or individuals. This is called the "inurement prohibition."

**Limit political activity.** No campaign activity for political candidates. Limited lobbying (there are specific tests for how much is allowed).

## Form 1023 vs. 1023-EZ

| Form | Who qualifies | Processing time | Complexity |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **1023-EZ** | Projected revenue under $50,000/year, assets under $250,000 | 2-4 weeks | Shorter, streamlined |
| **1023** | Everyone else | 3-6 months | Detailed, comprehensive |

<Info>
Most new nonprofits qualify for Form 1023-EZ. We'll assess your situation and recommend the appropriate form.

## What you'll need

To form a nonprofit and apply for 501(c)(3) status:

- **Mission statement** — Clear description of your exempt purpose
- **Articles of Incorporation** — With required IRS language about purpose and dissolution
- **Bylaws** — Governance rules for your organization
- **Board of Directors** — Minimum 3 directors in most states (unrelated individuals recommended)
- **Conflict of interest policy** — Required by IRS
- **Budget projection** — Expected revenue and expenses for first 3 years

## Timeline

| Step | How long it takes |
|------|-------------------|
| State incorporation | 1-5 business days |
| EIN application | Same day |
| Form 1023-EZ approval | 2-4 weeks |
| Form 1023 approval | 3-6 months |

## Board requirements

Nonprofit boards work differently than for-profit boards:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Minimum size | 3 directors in most states |
| Independence | Related parties should be a minority |
| Compensation | Board members typically serve unpaid |
| Duties | Fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty, duty of care |
| Meetings | Annual meeting required, document with minutes |

<Tip>
For credibility with grantors, avoid a board composed entirely of family members. Funders want to see independent oversight.
</Tip>

## Ongoing compliance

501(c)(3) organizations have annual requirements:

| Requirement | When it's due |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Form 990** | 15th day of 5th month after fiscal year-end |
| **State annual report** | Varies by state |
| **Charitable solicitation registration** | If fundraising in multiple states |
| **Board meetings** | At least annually |
| **Record keeping** | Maintain minutes, financial records, donor acknowledgments |

### Form 990 variants

| Form | Who files |
|------|-----------|
| 990-N (e-Postcard) | Gross receipts ≤ $50,000 |
| 990-EZ | Gross receipts < $200,000 and assets < $500,000 |
| 990 | Everyone else |

## What we don't cover

Pluvel handles formation and basic compliance. Some nonprofit needs require specialized help:
