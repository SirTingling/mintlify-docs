description: File your Beneficial Ownership Information Report with FinCEN.
---

Starting in 2024, the federal government wants to know who actually owns and controls American businesses. It's called a BOI Report, and the penalties for not filing are harsh — up to $500 per day in fines, plus potential criminal penalties.

Most small businesses need to file. Here's what you need to know.

## Who must file

Most LLCs and corporations must file a BOI Report if they were:

- Formed by filing with a Secretary of State (or similar office)
- A foreign company registered to do business in the US

### Exemptions

23 types of entities are exempt, including:

| Exempt entity type | Why exempt |
|-------------------|------------|
| Large operating companies | 20+ full-time US employees, $5M+ revenue, physical US office |
| SEC reporting companies | Already disclose ownership publicly |
| Banks and credit unions | Already heavily regulated |
| Insurance companies | Already regulated |
| Public utilities | Already regulated |
| Tax-exempt organizations | Already file with IRS |
| Inactive entities | Existed before 2020, no assets, no ownership changes, no payments in 12 months |

<Info>
Most small businesses don't qualify for exemptions and must file. When in doubt, file — there's no penalty for filing when you're exempt.

## What you report

A BOI Report includes information about:

**The company:**
- Legal name and any trade names (DBAs)
- Business address
- State/jurisdiction of formation
- EIN or tax ID

**Each beneficial owner:**
- Full legal name
- Date of birth
- Current residential address
- Identifying document (driver's license, passport, or state ID) — the number and a photo

**Company applicant (for companies formed after January 1, 2024):**
- The person who filed the formation documents
- The person who directed the filing

## Who is a beneficial owner?

A beneficial owner is anyone who:

1. **Directly or indirectly owns 25% or more** of the company, OR
2. **Exercises substantial control** over the company

### Substantial control includes:

- Senior officers (CEO, CFO, COO, general counsel)
- Anyone with authority to appoint/remove senior officers or board members
- Anyone who directs or substantially influences important decisions

<Warning>
Even if you own less than 25%, you may still be a beneficial owner if you exercise substantial control over the company.
</Warning>

## Filing deadlines

| When company was formed | Filing deadline |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Before January 1, 2024 | January 1, 2025 |
| During 2024 | 90 days from formation |
| January 1, 2025 or later | 30 days from formation |

### Updates

You must file an updated report within 30 days if:
- Ownership changes (new owners, percentages shift)
- Owner information changes (name, address, ID)
- Company information changes (name, address)

## How Pluvel handles BOI

<Steps>
  <Step title="We remind you">
    Before your deadline, you'll see a reminder in your dashboard and receive an email.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter owner information">
    For each beneficial owner, provide their name, date of birth, address, and upload their government ID.
  </Step>

  <Step title="We file with FinCEN">
    We submit your BOI Report electronically and store confirmation in your documents.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track changes">
    If owner information changes, we prompt you to file an update.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## FinCEN Identifier

Each beneficial owner can get a FinCEN Identifier — a unique number that can be used instead of providing full personal information on future BOI reports.

**Why get one:**
- Privacy — your personal details aren't shared with every company you own
- Convenience — use one number instead of re-entering everything
- Updates — change your information in one place, applies everywhere

<Tip>
If you own multiple companies, get a FinCEN Identifier. Update once, and it applies to all your BOI filings.
</Tip>

## Penalties for non-compliance

BOI reporting violations are serious:

| Violation | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| Failure to file | $500/day, up to $10,000 |
| Willful failure to file | Up to $10,000 and/or 2 years prison |
| False information | Up to $10,000 and/or 2 years prison |

<Warning>
Both the company and the individual responsible can be penalized. Don't ignore this requirement.
</Warning>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is the information public?">
    No. BOI information is stored in a secure, non-public database. Only authorized government agencies can access it — law enforcement, national security, financial regulators. Financial institutions may access it with your consent for certain purposes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I file every year?">
    No. BOI is not an annual filing. File once, then update within 30 days if anything changes. If nothing changes, no action needed until something does.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What ID can I use?">
    US driver's license, US passport, state-issued ID, or foreign passport. The document must be current (not expired).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I have multiple companies?">
    Each company files its own BOI Report. If you're a beneficial owner of multiple companies, your information appears on each (or use a FinCEN Identifier to simplify).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about trusts?">
    If a trust owns part of your company, report the trustee (who has authority over trust assets) and any beneficiaries with 25%+ ownership or substantial control.
  </Accordion>
