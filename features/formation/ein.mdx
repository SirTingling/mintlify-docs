Your business needs a tax ID before it can do almost anything. Open a bank account? Need an EIN. Hire employees? Need an EIN. File taxes? Need an EIN.

An EIN (Employer Identification Number) is a 9-digit number from the IRS that identifies your business. Think of it as a Social Security number for your company. Getting one takes about 5 minutes online, and it's completely free.

## When you need an EIN

You need an EIN if you:

- Have employees or plan to hire
- Operate as a corporation or partnership
- File employment, excise, or alcohol/tobacco/firearms tax returns
- Withhold taxes on income paid to non-resident aliens
- Have a Keogh plan
- Are involved with trusts, estates, nonprofits, or certain other organizations

<Info>
Even single-member LLCs with no employees usually need an EIN. Banks require it to open a business account, and using an EIN keeps your personal Social Security number off business documents.

## EIN for existing businesses

If you have an existing business without an EIN:

1. Go to **Settings → Company → Tax Information**
2. Click **Apply for EIN**
3. Confirm your business details
4. We submit the application

## EIN format

EINs look like this: **XX-XXXXXXX** (e.g., 12-3456789)

The first two digits indicate which IRS campus issued it. This doesn't affect your taxes — it's just administrative.

## When you need a new EIN

| Situation | New EIN needed? |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Change business name | No |
| Change business address | No |
| Change from sole prop to LLC | Yes |
| Change from LLC to corporation | Yes |
| Incorporate in a new state | Depends |
| New owner (partnership) | Sometimes |
| Bankruptcy | Sometimes |

<Warning>
Never use your personal Social Security Number when an EIN is required. Keep business and personal finances separate.
</Warning>

## What your EIN is used for

Your EIN appears on:

- Business tax returns (Form 1120, 1120-S, 1065)
- Employment tax returns (Form 941, 940)
- Business bank accounts
- Business credit applications
- Vendor W-9 forms
- 1099 forms you issue
- Business licenses and permits

## Protecting your EIN

Your EIN isn't as sensitive as a Social Security Number, but still protect it:

- Share only with banks, vendors, and the IRS when required
- Include on W-9 forms when clients request it
- Don't post it publicly on websites or social media

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does it take to get an EIN?">
    When applied for electronically (which is how Pluvel does it), you typically get your EIN within minutes during IRS business hours (7am-10pm ET, Monday-Friday). Applications outside these hours process when the IRS opens.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my SSN instead?">
    Sole proprietors without employees can use their SSN for business taxes. But most banks require an EIN to open a business account, and using an EIN keeps your SSN private.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I lose my EIN?">
    Your EIN doesn't change and never expires. If you forget it, check previous tax returns, bank statements, or call the IRS Business & Specialty Tax Line at 800-829-4933.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does my EIN expire?">
    No. Once issued, your EIN is permanent — even if you never use it or close the business.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I apply for an EIN myself?">
    Yes, through the IRS website (irs.gov) or by mailing Form SS-4. But Pluvel handles this automatically when you form with us.
