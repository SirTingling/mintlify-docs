description: Automatic alerts when something looks off in your transactions.

You're not going to manually review every transaction. Nobody does. But you also don't want to miss the one that's a duplicate charge, a fraudulent withdrawal, or an expense that's 3x higher than usual.

Anomaly Detection watches your transactions and flags the weird ones.

## What Gets Flagged

Pluvel looks for patterns that don't match your history:

**Unusual amounts** — Your AWS bill is normally $200. This month it's $1,800. Flagged.

**Duplicate charges** — Same vendor, same amount, same day. Probably a mistake.

**New vendors with large amounts** — First transaction from "XYZ Corp" and it's $5,000? Worth a look.

**Round numbers from vendors** — Your utility bill is always $147.32. Suddenly it's exactly $500. That's odd.

**Timing anomalies** — A charge at 3am from a vendor you normally see during business hours.

## How It Works

When you connect your bank accounts, Pluvel builds a profile of your normal activity. After about 30 days of data, it knows what "normal" looks like for you.

New transactions get compared against that profile. If something's off by more than a configurable threshold, you get an alert.

Anomaly detection improves over time. The more transactions it sees, the better it understands what's normal for your business.

## Viewing Anomalies

Go to **Finance → Accounting → Anomaly Detection** to see all flagged transactions.

Each anomaly shows:
- The transaction details
- Why it was flagged (amount, timing, vendor, etc.)
- How different it is from your typical pattern
- Options to dismiss, investigate, or mark as fraud

## Taking Action

When you see an anomaly, you have options:

| Action | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Dismiss** | It's fine, just unusual. Don't flag similar ones. |
| **Expected** | You knew about it (planned large purchase). |
| **Investigate** | Need to look into it. Adds to your task list. |
| **Report Fraud** | Contact your bank immediately. We'll help document it. |

Dismissed anomalies help train the system. If you dismiss several $5,000 charges from the same vendor, it'll stop flagging those.

## Alert Settings

Control how aggressive the detection is:

**Sensitivity** — High catches more but may have false positives. Low catches less but misses fewer important things. Most users leave it at Medium.

**Notification preferences** — Get alerts via email, in-app notification, or both. You can set thresholds — only email me for anomalies over $500, for example.

**Categories to watch** — Maybe you only care about bank withdrawals and wire transfers, not every small charge. Configure which transaction types get scrutinized.

Go to **Settings → Notifications → Anomaly Alerts** to adjust.

## Real Examples

**Caught a subscription you forgot to cancel.**
A user saw their old project management tool still charging $49/month, six months after they'd switched. Flagged because it was from a "dormant" vendor.

**Spotted a double-charge.**
Vendor charged twice for the same invoice. Same amount, same day. Anomaly Detection flagged it, user got a refund.

**Identified fraud early.**
A $2,000 charge appeared from a vendor the user had never heard of. Flagged immediately because it was a new vendor with a large amount. Turned out their card was compromised. They caught it within hours instead of discovering it at month-end.

## Limitations

Anomaly Detection isn't perfect. It can't catch:

- Fraud that looks like normal activity (if someone knows your patterns)
- Gradual increases that stay within thresholds
- Issues with cash transactions (we only see what's in your connected accounts)

It's a safety net, not a replacement for reviewing your statements.

## Privacy

All analysis happens within Pluvel. We're not sharing your transaction data with external services to detect anomalies — it's all done on our infrastructure with your data.
