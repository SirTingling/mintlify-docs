Bought a $5,000 laptop? A $30,000 vehicle? That's not just an expense — it's an asset that loses value over time. Fixed Assets in Pluvel helps you track these purchases, calculate depreciation, and keep your books accurate.

## What's a Fixed Asset?

Anything you buy for business use that:
- Costs more than your capitalization threshold (typically $2,500+)
- Lasts more than a year
- Gradually loses value over time

Common examples: computers, office furniture, vehicles, machinery, buildings.

Not fixed assets: office supplies, software subscriptions, inventory for resale.

## Adding an Asset

Go to **Finance → Accounting → Fixed Assets** and click **Add Asset**.

Enter:

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Name | MacBook Pro 16" |
| Category | Computer Equipment |
| Purchase Date | March 15, 2024 |
| Purchase Price | $3,499 |
| Useful Life | 5 years |
| Depreciation Method | Straight-line |
| Salvage Value | $0 |

If you already recorded the purchase as a regular expense, link that transaction. Pluvel will reclassify it from an expense to an asset.

## Depreciation Methods

Pluvel supports the common methods:

**Straight-line** — Same amount each year. $3,000 asset over 5 years = $600/year depreciation. Simple and common.

**Double declining balance** — More depreciation early, less later. Good for assets that lose value quickly (technology).

**MACRS** — IRS-preferred method with specific recovery periods. If your accountant mentions MACRS, use this.

Your accountant can tell you which method to use. When in doubt, straight-line is usually fine for simple businesses.

## How Depreciation Works

Each month (or year, depending on your settings), Pluvel creates a depreciation entry:

- Debit: Depreciation Expense (shows up on your P&L)
- Credit: Accumulated Depreciation (reduces the asset's book value)

You don't have to do anything. It happens automatically based on the schedule you set up.

<Info>
Depreciation posts to your books on the schedule you choose — monthly, quarterly, or annually. Monthly is most common for accurate financial statements.

The Fixed Assets list shows:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Asset Name | What you called it |
| Category | Type of asset |
| Purchase Price | Original cost |
| Book Value | Current value after depreciation |
| Monthly Depreciation | How much it depreciates each period |
| Status | Active, fully depreciated, or disposed |

Click any asset to see its full history: original purchase, all depreciation entries, and current value.

## Selling or Disposing Assets

When you sell, donate, or throw away an asset:

1. Go to the asset record
2. Click **Dispose**
3. Enter the disposal date and amount received (if any)

Pluvel calculates the gain or loss:

- If you sell for more than book value: gain
- If you sell for less than book value: loss
- If you throw it away: loss equal to remaining book value

The gain or loss shows up on your P&L.

## Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I bought a vehicle for business">
    Add it as a fixed asset. Vehicles typically depreciate over 5 years using MACRS. If you use it partially for personal use, only add the business portion as an asset. (Ask your accountant about the details — vehicle depreciation gets complicated.)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I already expensed something I should have capitalized">
    No problem. Add it as a fixed asset now and link the original transaction. Pluvel will reclassify it. You may need an adjusting entry if this crosses fiscal years.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My computer died after 2 years">
    Dispose of it with $0 proceeds. The remaining book value becomes a loss. If it was insured and you got paid, enter the insurance payment as the disposal amount.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about improvements to an asset?">
    Major improvements (new engine, office renovation) can be capitalized and added to the asset's value. Minor repairs are just expenses. The test: does it extend the useful life or just maintain it?

## Reporting

**Fixed Asset Register** — Complete list of all assets with cost, depreciation, and book value.

**Depreciation Schedule** — Shows depreciation by asset, by month or year.

**Tax Report** — Formatted for tax prep, showing MACRS depreciation for the tax year.

Find these in **Reports → Assets**.

## A Note on Taxes

Book depreciation (what's on your financial statements) and tax depreciation (what you report to the IRS) can be different. Section 179 deductions, bonus depreciation, and MACRS rules can create differences.

Pluvel tracks book depreciation. Your accountant may make adjustments for tax purposes. This is normal — most businesses have book-tax differences for fixed assets.

<Warning>
Fixed assets over $2,500 typically need to be capitalized for tax purposes. Expensing them incorrectly can cause issues with the IRS. When in doubt, check with your accountant.
