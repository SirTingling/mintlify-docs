If you sell physical products, inventory tracking helps you know what you have, what it cost, and how much you're making on each sale. Pluvel handles basic inventory — not warehouse management, but enough for most small product businesses.

<Info>
Inventory tracking is included on Growth and Scale plans. Starter plan users can upgrade to access it.

## What Inventory Tracking Does

- **Tracks quantities** — How many units of each product you have
- **Calculates COGS** — What you paid for the items you sold
- **Values inventory** — What your unsold stock is worth
- **Monitors levels** — Alerts when stock is running low

## Setting Up Products

Go to **Finance → Accounting → Inventory** and click **Add Product**.

Enter:

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Name | Widget Pro |
| SKU | WP-001 |
| Cost | $15.00 (what you pay) |
| Price | $39.99 (what you charge) |
| Starting quantity | 50 units |
| Reorder point | 10 units |

The cost is your landed cost — purchase price plus shipping, duties, etc. This is what drives your cost of goods sold.

## Purchasing Inventory

When you buy inventory from a supplier:

1. Create a bill from the vendor
2. Mark line items as inventory purchases
3. Select the product
4. Enter quantity received

Your inventory count goes up. The cost goes to Inventory (an asset account), not directly to expenses.

## Selling Inventory

When you sell something:

**From an invoice** — Add an inventory item to an invoice. When the invoice is created, quantity decreases and COGS is recorded.

**From a sales integration** — If you connect Shopify or Square, sales sync automatically and update inventory.

**Manual adjustment** — For sales outside Pluvel, manually adjust inventory with a reason.

## Cost of Goods Sold

Here's the accounting part. When you buy inventory:

- Inventory (Asset) increases
- Cash or AP decreases

When you sell inventory:

- Revenue increases
- Inventory (Asset) decreases
- COGS (Expense) increases

COGS is the cost of the items you sold, not the items you bought. This is important for accurate profit reporting.

## Valuation Methods

Pluvel supports common inventory valuation methods:

**FIFO (First In, First Out)** — Oldest inventory sells first. If you bought 10 units at $10, then 10 at $12, selling 5 uses the $10 cost. Most common, usually required for tax.

**Average Cost** — Every purchase updates your average cost. Simple, less precise.

Choose in **Settings → Accounting → Inventory**. Stick with one method — changing mid-year creates headaches.

## Inventory Reports

**Inventory Valuation** — What you have and what it's worth.

**Stock Movement** — Purchases in, sales out, adjustments.

**COGS Report** — Cost of goods sold by product, period, or category.

**Low Stock Alert** — Products at or below reorder point.

Find these in **Reports → Inventory**.

## Adjustments

Sometimes inventory counts don't match reality:

- Theft or damage
- Counting errors
- Returns you didn't record

Go to a product and click **Adjust Quantity**. Enter the new count and a reason. Pluvel creates an adjustment entry to account for the difference.

## Physical Counts

Periodically (monthly, quarterly, annually), do a physical count:

1. Print your inventory list
2. Walk through and count everything
3. Note discrepancies
4. Enter adjustments in Pluvel

Regular counts catch problems early. Annual counts are usually required for tax purposes.

## Limitations

Pluvel handles basic inventory. We're not a full warehouse management system. We don't do:

- Multiple warehouse locations
- Lot tracking or serial numbers
- Manufacturing / BOM (bill of materials)
- Barcode scanning
- Kitting or bundling

If you need those, you'll want a dedicated inventory system that integrates with Pluvel.

## Integrations

For automated inventory updates:

| Integration | What It Does |
|-------------|--------------|
| Shopify | Sales reduce inventory automatically |
| Square | POS sales sync to Pluvel |
| Manual import | Upload inventory counts via CSV |

<Warning>
If you use an external system for inventory, make sure it syncs to Pluvel — or you'll have duplicate entry and discrepancies. Pick one system of record for inventory counts.
</Warning>

## E-commerce Sellers

If you sell on Shopify, Amazon, or similar:

1. Connect the integration
2. Map your products to Pluvel inventory items
3. Sales sync automatically
4. Inventory counts stay in sync

Don't manually create invoices for online sales — the integration handles that.
