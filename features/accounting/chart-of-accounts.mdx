Your chart of accounts is where every transaction ends up. Money comes in? It goes to a revenue account. You pay rent? It goes to an expense account. Buy equipment? Asset account.

Think of it as a filing system for money. The better organized it is, the easier it is to understand where your money goes — and to answer questions like "how much did I spend on software this year?"

## The five types of accounts

Every account falls into one of five categories:

| Type | What it tracks | Increases when... |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Assets** | What you own | You receive money or buy something valuable |
| **Liabilities** | What you owe | You borrow money or receive a bill |
| **Equity** | Owner's stake | You invest in the business or keep profits |
| **Revenue** | Money earned | You invoice a customer or make a sale |
| **Expenses** | Money spent | You buy something or pay for a service |

That's it. Every transaction in your business touches at least one of these.

## Setting up your chart

When you complete Pluvel setup, you choose a template:

| Template | Accounts | Best for |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Simple | ~25 | Freelancers, consultants, solo businesses |
| Standard | ~50 | Most small businesses |
| Advanced | ~100+ | Businesses with complex reporting needs |

Don't overthink it. Start with Standard. You can add accounts later but removing them is harder (accounts with transactions can't be deleted, only archived).

## How accounts are organized

Accounts form a hierarchy:

```
Assets
├── Cash and Bank
│   ├── Operating Checking
│   ├── Savings
│   └── Petty Cash
├── Accounts Receivable
└── Fixed Assets
    ├── Equipment
    └── Vehicles
```

Sub-accounts roll up to their parents. When you look at a report, you can see "Cash and Bank: $50,000" or drill down to see each individual bank account.

## Adding accounts

Go to **Accounting → Chart of Accounts → Add Account**.

You'll need:
- **Name** — What you'll see in reports ("Software Subscriptions", "Travel Expenses")
- **Type** — One of the five categories
- **Parent** (optional) — Where it sits in the hierarchy
- **Number** (optional) — Pluvel auto-assigns if you skip this

That's it. The account is ready to use.

<Info>
Most businesses add 5-10 custom accounts over time. Common additions: specific expense categories for your industry, separate bank accounts, or sub-accounts for tracking by department.

## Account numbers

Account numbers help organize and sort. Pluvel uses a standard numbering scheme:

| Range | Type |
|-------|------|
| 1000-1999 | Assets |
| 2000-2999 | Liabilities |
| 3000-3999 | Equity |
| 4000-4999 | Revenue |
| 5000-5999 | Cost of Goods Sold |
| 6000-8999 | Expenses |
| 9000-9999 | Other Income/Expense |

You don't have to memorize these — Pluvel auto-assigns within the right range based on account type. But if you care about account numbers (accountants often do), you can set them manually.

## Common chart of accounts mistakes

**Too many accounts.** Having separate accounts for "Google Ads", "Facebook Ads", "LinkedIn Ads", and "Twitter Ads" seems organized, but your reports become unreadable. One "Advertising" account with a memo field for the platform is usually better.

**Too few accounts.** Everything dumped into "Miscellaneous Expense" means you can't analyze spending. If you're constantly using "Misc" or "Other", you need more specific accounts.

**Wrong account types.** Putting owner draws in "Expenses" instead of "Equity" makes your P&L misleading. If something seems off in your reports, check that accounts are the right type.

**Duplicate accounts.** "Office Supplies" and "Office Supply" both exist because you created one and forgot. Merge them.

## Editing accounts

Click any account to edit:

- Rename it
- Change its parent
- Update the description
- Deactivate it (if you're not using it anymore)

<Warning>
Be careful changing an account's type after transactions exist. A "Software" expense becoming a "Software" asset changes your financial statements retroactively. Ask your accountant first.
</Warning>

## Deactivating vs. deleting

**Deactivating** hides an account from dropdowns but keeps it in reports. Use this for accounts you no longer need but have historical transactions.

**Deleting** removes the account entirely. You can only delete accounts with zero transactions.

Most of the time, deactivate rather than delete.

## Merging accounts

Made duplicates? Merge them:

1. Go to **Chart of Accounts**
2. Click **Merge Accounts**
3. Select the accounts to combine
4. Choose which one to keep
5. All transactions move to the surviving account

## Importing from another system

Switching from QuickBooks, Xero, or Wave? You can import your chart of accounts:

1. Export your chart from the old system (usually CSV)
2. Go to **Chart of Accounts → Import**
3. Map columns (account name, number, type, parent)
4. Review the preview
5. Import

Pluvel will match account types as best it can. Review the results — sometimes "Fixed Assets" gets imported as a generic "Asset" and needs adjustment.

## Tips from real users

**Freelancers:** You probably need 20-30 accounts max. Revenue for each type of service you offer, expenses broken out by category, and a few asset accounts for your bank and equipment. Don't overcomplicate it.

**Agencies:** Consider tracking revenue by service type (Design, Development, Strategy) and expenses by department if you have teams.

**E-commerce:** You'll want Cost of Goods Sold accounts for inventory tracking, plus separate expense accounts for shipping, packaging, and marketplace fees.

**Professional services:** Keep client-related expenses (meals, travel, client gifts) separate from operating expenses for profitability analysis.

## Viewing your chart

Go to **Accounting → Chart of Accounts** to see everything:

- Filter by type (just show expenses)
- Filter by status (hide inactive accounts)
- Search by name or number
- See current balances

Click any account to see its transaction history.
