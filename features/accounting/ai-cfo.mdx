Most small business owners aren't accountants. You started a company because you're great at what you do — not because you love staring at spreadsheets. That's where AI CFO comes in.

Think of it as having a financial advisor on call 24/7, except it actually knows your numbers inside and out.

## What AI CFO Does

It watches your books constantly and tells you things like:

- "Your cash will run out in 47 days if spending stays the same"
- "Revenue is up 23% this quarter, but margins dropped 4%"
- "You're paying $2,400/month more for software than similar businesses"
- "That $15,000 invoice from Acme Corp is 45 days overdue"

Not generic advice. Your specific situation, with your actual numbers.

## The Dashboard

When you open AI CFO, you'll see three things:

**Insights** — The stuff that matters right now. Cash runway, unusual expenses, revenue trends. Updated daily.

**Recommendations** — Actions you might want to take. "Consider following up on overdue invoices totaling $23,500" or "Your Q3 estimated taxes are due in 12 days."

**Ask Anything** — Type a question in plain English. "How much did I spend on contractors last year?" or "What's my gross margin?" It pulls the answer from your actual data.

## How It Works

AI CFO analyzes:

| Data Source | What It Looks For |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Bank transactions | Spending patterns, unusual charges, recurring costs |
| Invoices | Payment trends, customer reliability, revenue concentration |
| Bills | Vendor costs, payment timing, potential savings |
| Payroll | Labor costs, headcount changes, tax liability |
| Historical data | Year-over-year trends, seasonal patterns |

It's not making things up. Every insight links back to the actual transactions behind it. Click any number to see the source.

## Real Examples

Here's what AI CFO surfaced for actual Pluvel users:

**"You're overpaying for merchant processing."**
A retail business was paying 3.2% on card transactions. Industry average is 2.6%. AI CFO flagged it, they switched processors, saved $400/month.

**"Your biggest customer hasn't paid in 60 days."**
One client represented 40% of a freelancer's revenue. They were 60 days late. AI CFO flagged the concentration risk AND the overdue invoice. The freelancer diversified and started requiring deposits.

**"Runway is shorter than you think."**
A startup thought they had 8 months of runway. AI CFO factored in their actual burn rate increase (they'd been hiring) and showed it was closer to 5 months. They adjusted spending before it became a crisis.

## Privacy and Security

Your data never leaves Pluvel's servers. AI CFO runs on the same infrastructure as your accounting data — we're not sending your financials to a third-party AI service.

The model sees your transactions, not your personal information. It knows "Coffee shop - $4.50" not "Jordan bought coffee at 9am on Tuesday."

## What It Won't Do

AI CFO gives insights and suggestions. It doesn't:

- File taxes (that's still on you or your accountant)
- Make decisions for you
- Move money or execute transactions
- Replace professional advice for complex situations

If it suggests something significant (like "you might want to restructure as an S-corp"), it'll recommend talking to a professional.

## Getting Started

AI CFO is included on Growth and Scale plans. If you're on Starter, you'll see a preview of what it can do with an upgrade prompt.

Once enabled:

1. Go to **Finance → Accounting → AI CFO**
2. Let it analyze your data (takes a few minutes on first load)
3. Review your initial insights
4. Try asking it something

The more history you have in Pluvel, the better the insights get. If you just started, give it a month of data before expecting detailed trend analysis.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is this actually useful or just a gimmick?">
    Fair question. We built it because business owners kept asking the same things: "Am I making money?" "When will I run out of cash?" "Is that expense normal?" Instead of making you dig through reports, AI CFO surfaces the answers proactively. Whether it's useful depends on whether you want that visibility. Most users check it weekly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I turn it off?">
    Yes. Go to Settings → Features → AI CFO and toggle it off. Your data stays, you just won't see the insights.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does my accountant see this?">
    If they have access to your Pluvel account (Firm Mode), yes. Many accountants use AI CFO insights as conversation starters with clients.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How accurate are the predictions?">
    Cash runway and trend projections are based on your actual spending patterns. They assume things continue as they have been. If you know something's changing (big expense coming, seasonal dip), factor that in yourself. The numbers are directional, not guarantees.
