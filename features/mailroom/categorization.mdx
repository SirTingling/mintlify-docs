Not all mail is equal. An IRS audit notice demands your immediate attention. A credit card offer does not. Yet both arrive in the same stack of mail.

We automatically categorize every piece of mail so urgent items float to the top and junk gets filtered out of your main view. Government notices trigger immediate alerts; marketing mail quietly waits in a folder you can ignore.

## Category types

| Category | Color | Priority | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| IRS | Red | Urgent | Tax notices, payment demands, audit letters |
| State | Orange | High | Secretary of State, tax agencies, compliance |
| Legal | Orange | High | Court documents, legal notices, demand letters |
| Bank/Financial | Blue | Medium | Statements, notices, account updates |
| Business | Gray | Normal | Vendor letters, general correspondence |
| Junk | Light gray | Low | Marketing, solicitations, catalogs |

## How categorization works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sender recognition">
    We check the return address against our database of known senders (IRS, state agencies, major banks, etc.).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Content analysis">
    For unknown senders, we scan document content for keywords that indicate document type.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Category assigned">
    Based on sender and content, we assign a category. You see this in your inbox.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notification triggered">
    High-priority categories trigger immediate notifications; lower priority may go to digest.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Priority handling

### Urgent (IRS, State, Legal)

- Scanned within hours of receipt
- Immediate email and push notification
- Prominent display in inbox
- Marked with urgency indicator

### Normal (Bank, Business)

- Scanned within 1 business day
- Email notification (configurable timing)
- Standard inbox display

### Low (Junk)

- Logged but not scanned by default
- No notification
- Visible in "All Mail" filter only
- Auto-shredded after 30 days (configurable)

## Junk mail handling

We identify likely junk mail by:

- Known marketing senders
- Bulk mail class indicators
- "Resident" or generic addressing

### Junk mail options

Go to **Settings → Mailroom → Junk Mail**:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Don't scan | Logged only, not scanned or stored |
| Scan but filter | Scanned but hidden from main inbox |
| Treat as regular | Scanned and shown with other mail |
| Auto-shred | Destroyed after 7 days, never scanned |

## Correcting categories

If we miscategorize something:

1. Open the document
2. Click the category badge
3. Select the correct category
4. (Optional) Report sender for future improvement

### Training the system

When you correct a category:

- Future mail from that sender uses your correction
- Our system learns from corrections across all users
- Accuracy improves over time

## Creating custom categories

Beyond the default categories, you can add your own:

1. Go to **Settings → Mailroom → Categories**
2. Click **Add Category**
3. Name it and choose a color
4. Set notification preferences

### Routing rules

Create rules to auto-assign categories based on:

- Sender address or name
- Keywords in content
- Envelope markings

Example rule: "If sender contains 'First National Bank', categorize as Bank/Financial"

## Category-based views

Filter your inbox by category:

1. Click the category filter dropdown
2. Select one or more categories
3. Inbox shows only matching mail

### Saved views

Save frequently used filters:

1. Set your filters
2. Click **Save View**
3. Name it (e.g., "Tax Documents Only")
4. Access from the Views dropdown

## Category reporting

See mail statistics by category:

1. Go to **Mailroom → Analytics**
2. View breakdown by category
3. Track mail volume trends

This helps identify:

- Which types of mail you receive most
- Seasonal patterns (tax season, renewal periods)
- Whether junk filtering is working

## Notification customization

Each category has independent notification settings:

| Category | Email | Push | Timing |
|----------|-------|------|--------|
| IRS | Yes | Yes | Immediate |
| State | Yes | Yes | Immediate |
| Legal | Yes | Yes | Immediate |
| Bank | Yes | Optional | Same day |
| Business | Yes | No | Daily digest |
| Junk | No | No | Never |

Adjust in **Settings → Mailroom → Notifications → By Category**.
