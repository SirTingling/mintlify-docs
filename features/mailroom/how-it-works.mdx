---

An IRS notice sits in a mailbox for three weeks. By the time someone checks, the response deadline has passed. A state compliance warning gets buried under junk mail. A bank statement with fraud alerts goes unread.

Physical business mail is a liability when you're not at the address every day. The digital mailroom fixes this: we receive your mail, scan it within 24 hours, and send you the documents you can actually read — from anywhere, on any device.

## The process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mail arrives">
    Mail sent to your registered agent address is received at our secure facility.
  </Step>

  <Step title="We scan it">
    Within 1 business day, mail is opened and scanned at 300 DPI. Both sides are captured.
  </Step>

  <Step title="We categorize it">
    Our system identifies the sender and document type (IRS notice, state filing, junk mail, etc.).
  </Step>

  <Step title="You're notified">
    You receive an email notification with a preview. Urgent items (IRS, state agencies) trigger immediate alerts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="You take action">
    View, download, forward, or shred—all from your dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What gets scanned

| Mail Type | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Government notices | Scanned immediately, urgent notification |
| Bank statements | Scanned, categorized as financial |
| Business correspondence | Scanned same day |
| Junk mail | Logged but not scanned by default |
| Packages | Held for forwarding or pickup |

<Info>
You can change junk mail handling in **Settings → Mailroom**. Some customers want all mail scanned regardless of type.

## Mail address

Your registered agent address is:

```
[Your Company Name]
[Registered Agent Address Line 1]
[City, State ZIP]
```

Find your exact address in **Company → Documents → Registered Agent**.

This address is where the state sends official documents, and where you should direct any business mail you want digitized.

## Notification settings

Control how you hear about new mail:

| Mail Type | Default Notification |
|-----------|---------------------|
| IRS notices | Email + push immediately |
| State filings | Email immediately |
| Legal documents | Email immediately |
| Bank/financial | Email within 1 hour |
| General business | Daily digest |
| Junk mail | None (visible in dashboard) |

Customize notifications in **Settings → Mailroom → Notifications**.

## Response times

| Item | Processing Time |
|------|-----------------|
| Regular mail | Scanned within 1 business day |
| Urgent items (IRS, state) | Scanned same day, immediate notification |
| Packages | Logged same day, held for instruction |
| Mail forwarding | Ships within 2 business days |

## Security and privacy

### Physical security

- Secure, access-controlled facility
- Background-checked staff
- Mail handled by trained personnel only

### Digital security

- Scans encrypted at rest and in transit
- Access limited to authenticated users
- 90-day automatic retention (configurable)

### Compliance

- SOC 2 Type II certified facility
- HIPAA-compliant handling available
- Audit logs for all access

## What the mailroom doesn't do

- **Open packages** — We log receipt but don't open packages
- **Respond to mail** — We notify you; you take action
- **Legal advice** — We categorize, not interpret
- **Same-day forwarding** — Shipping takes 1-2 business days after you request it
