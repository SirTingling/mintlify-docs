Different people want different things from their mailroom. Some want immediate alerts for everything. Others prefer a weekly digest so mail doesn't interrupt their day. Some want junk mail scanned "just in case." Others want it shredded on sight.

The settings let you configure exactly how your mailroom works — notification timing, automatic rules, forwarding addresses, and retention policies.

## Accessing settings

Go to **Settings → Mailroom** to configure:

- Notifications
- Forwarding addresses
- Junk mail handling
- Retention policies
- Automatic rules

## Notification settings

### By priority

| Category | Email | Push | Timing |
|----------|-------|------|--------|
| Urgent (IRS, State, Legal) | Always | Always | Immediate |
| Important (Bank, Business) | Configurable | Configurable | Configurable |
| Low (Junk) | Never | Never | Never |

### Notification timing

For non-urgent mail, choose when to be notified:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Immediate | Notify as soon as mail is scanned |
| Same day | Notify by end of business day |
| Daily digest | One email with all new mail |
| Weekly digest | One email per week |

### Digest schedule

If you choose digest:

- **Daily:** Sent at 9 AM your local time
- **Weekly:** Sent Monday at 9 AM

Change your timezone in **Settings → Account → Timezone**.

### Quiet hours

Suppress notifications during certain hours:

1. Enable **Quiet Hours**
2. Set start and end time (e.g., 9 PM - 8 AM)
3. Urgent mail still notifies; everything else waits

## Forwarding addresses

Manage addresses for mail forwarding:

### Add an address

1. Go to **Settings → Mailroom → Forwarding Addresses**
2. Click **Add Address**
3. Enter:
   - Label (e.g., "Home", "Office", "Accountant")
   - Street address
   - City, State, ZIP
4. Optionally set as default

### Default address

Your default address is pre-selected when you forward mail. Change it by clicking **Set as Default** on any address.

### Remove an address

1. Click the address
2. Click **Remove**
3. Confirm deletion

In-progress shipments continue to the removed address.

## Junk mail handling

Configure how we treat likely junk mail:

| Setting | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| **Scan and filter** | Scanned but hidden from main inbox |
| **Scan and show** | Scanned and shown with all mail |
| **Don't scan** | Logged only, not digitized |
| **Auto-shred** | Destroyed without scanning |

<Info>
"Auto-shred" is aggressive—use it only if you're sure you don't need marketing mail.
</Info>

### Junk mail review

Even if filtered, junk mail is accessible:

1. Go to **Mailroom**
2. Click **Filter → Category → Junk**
3. Review and recategorize if needed

## Retention policies

How long we keep your mail:

### Digital scans

| Plan | Default Retention |
|------|-------------------|
| Starter | 1 year |
| Growth | 3 years |
| Scale | 7 years |

After retention expires, scans are deleted. Download important documents before expiration.

### Physical mail

Physical mail is held for 90 days unless you request an action:

- **Forwarded** — Shipped to you
- **Shredded** — Destroyed
- **Extended hold** — Request additional 90 days ($2/item)

After 90 days with no action, mail is securely shredded.

### Changing retention

To extend digital retention:

1. Go to **Settings → Mailroom → Retention**

## Automatic rules

### Create a rule
