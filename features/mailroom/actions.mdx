description: Forward, download, archive, or shred your business mail.

A piece of mail arrives. You read the scan. Now what?

If it's important, download a copy or forward the original to your home office. If it's routine, archive it to keep your inbox clean. If it's junk, shred it — we'll destroy the physical document so it doesn't pile up in storage.

Once your mail is scanned, you control what happens next. Everything happens from your dashboard.
