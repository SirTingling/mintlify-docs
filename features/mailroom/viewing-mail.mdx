You're in a meeting when an IRS notice arrives at your registered agent address. Instead of waiting days for it to be forwarded (or worse, forgotten), you get a notification and open the scan on your phone. The notice needs a response by Friday — good thing you know about it now.

That's the point of the digital mailroom: instant access to your business mail from anywhere, without touching physical paper.

## Accessing the mailroom

1. Go to **Mailroom** in the sidebar
2. You'll see your mail inbox sorted by date received

## The mail list

Your inbox shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Date | When the mail was received |
| From | Sender (extracted from envelope/letterhead) |
| Category | Document type (IRS, State, Bank, etc.) |
| Status | New, Viewed, Actioned |
| Preview | Thumbnail of first page |

### Filtering mail

Use filters to find what you need:

- **By category** — IRS, State, Bank, Legal, Business, Junk
- **By status** — New, Viewed, Actioned, Archived
- **By date range** — Last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, Custom
- **Search** — Find by sender name or content (OCR-searchable)

## Viewing a document

Click any mail item to open the document viewer:

### Document viewer features

| Feature | Description |

### Multi-page documents

Documents with multiple pages show:

- Thumbnail strip for quick navigation

## Document details

Each scanned item includes metadata:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Received | Date the physical mail arrived |
| Scanned | Date we processed it |
| Sender | Extracted from envelope/letterhead |
| Category | Document type classification |
| Pages | Number of pages |
| File size | PDF size for download |

### Sender recognition

We automatically identify common senders:

- **IRS** — Internal Revenue Service notices
- **State agencies** — Secretary of State, Tax, etc.
- **Banks** — Recognized financial institutions
- **Known vendors** — Previously identified senders

Unknown senders show as "Unknown" until you categorize them.

## Search and OCR

All scanned documents are processed with OCR (Optical Character Recognition):

### How search works

1. Type keywords in the search bar
2. We search document content, not just sender names
3. Results highlight matching documents
4. Click to jump directly to the relevant page

### Search tips

- Search for specific terms: "Notice of Assessment"
- Search for numbers: "Form 941" or "$1,234.56"
- Use sender names: "California Franchise Tax Board"

<Info>
OCR accuracy is typically 95%+ for printed documents. Handwritten notes may not be searchable.
