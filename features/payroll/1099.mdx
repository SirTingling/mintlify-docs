Paid a freelancer, consultant, or contractor more than $600 this year? You owe them a 1099-NEC. It's the contractor equivalent of a W-2 — tells them (and the IRS) how much you paid them so they can report it on their taxes.

The deadline is January 31. Miss it and there are penalties. Forget someone and they're upset when the IRS asks why their income doesn't match what was reported.

## When you need to send a 1099-NEC

You must issue 1099-NEC when **all** of these are true:

- You paid them $600 or more during the year
- They're not an employee (no W-2)
- Payment was for services (not goods/products)
- They're an individual, partnership, or LLC (not a C-corp or S-corp)

### Who doesn't get a 1099

- **Corporations** — C-corps and S-corps are exempt (with some exceptions)
- **Under $600** — You can still send one, but it's not required
- **Merchandise purchases** — Buying products, not services
- **Personal payments** — Not business-related

<Info>
When in doubt, collect a W-9 upfront. It tells you their tax ID and entity type so you know whether a 1099 is required.

## 1099 timeline

| When | What to do |
|------|--------|
| Throughout the year | Track every payment to contractors |
| December | Review totals, chase down missing W-9s |
| **January 31** | Deadline to send 1099s to contractors |
| **January 31** | Deadline to file with IRS |

Both deadlines are the same day. Don't wait until January 30.

## Generating 1099s

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Tax Forms">
    Navigate to **Payroll → Tax Forms → 1099s**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the list">
    Pluvel shows all contractors you paid $600 or more. Make sure no one is missing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify information">
    For each contractor, check:
    - **Name** — Exactly as it appears on their W-9
    - **Address** — Current mailing address
    - **Tax ID** — SSN or EIN from their W-9
    - **Total paid** — Does it look right?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate forms">
    Click **Generate 1099s**. Forms created for everyone on the list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="File and send">
    E-file with IRS. Send copies to contractors (email or mail).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Collecting W-9s

Get the W-9 *before* you pay someone. January is too late to chase them down.

| W-9 field | What you need it for |
|-------|---------|
| Name | Goes on the 1099, must match their tax return |
| Business name | If they operate under a different name |
| Tax classification | Tells you if they're a corp (possibly exempt from 1099) |
| Address | Where to mail the 1099 |
| Tax ID | SSN or EIN — required for filing |

### Electronic W-9 collection

Skip the PDF back-and-forth:

1. Click **Request W-9** on the contractor's profile
2. They receive a secure link
3. Complete and e-sign online
4. Info saves automatically

If they're slow to respond, Pluvel sends reminders.

## 1099-NEC boxes explained

| Box | What it shows |
|-----|-------------|
| 1 | Total nonemployee compensation (what you paid them) |
| 4 | Federal tax withheld (usually $0 unless backup withholding) |
| 5-7 | State tax info (if applicable) |

For most contractors, only Box 1 has an amount. The rest are zeros.

## Filing with the IRS

Pluvel e-files 1099s on your behalf:

1. You review and approve the forms
2. We submit electronically to the IRS
3. You receive filing confirmation
4. Contractors get their copies

E-filing is faster and catches errors before submission.

### Paper filing (if you must)

1. Print 1099s on official IRS forms (you can't use plain paper)
2. Mail Copy A to the IRS
3. Mail Copy B to the contractor
4. Keep Copy C for your records

Paper filing has more room for error and takes longer. E-file if possible.

## State filing

Many states want 1099 data too:

| Requirement | How it works |
|-------------|--------|
| Combined filing | Most states participate — IRS shares the data automatically |
| Separate filing | Some states require you to file directly with them |

Pluvel handles combined filing automatically. If your state requires separate filing, we'll let you know.

## Corrections (1099-NEC Corrected)

Made a mistake? Wrong amount, wrong name?

1. Generate a corrected 1099-NEC
2. Mark it as a correction (checkbox)
3. File with IRS
4. Send to the contractor

The corrected form replaces the original. The contractor may need to amend their tax return.

## Backup withholding

If a contractor refuses to give you their Tax ID:

- You must withhold 24% from their payments
- Report the withholding in Box 4
- Deposit the withholding with the IRS

This is a pain for everyone. Collect W-9s upfront to avoid it.

## Tracking payments all year

Don't wait until December to figure out who needs 1099s. Pluvel tracks:

- Every payment to every contractor
- Running YTD total per person
- Alerts when someone approaches $600
- Warnings for missing W-9s

"This contractor is at $580 and has no W-9 on file" — you'll know before it's a problem.
