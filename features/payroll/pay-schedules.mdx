"When do I get paid?" is the first question every employee asks. Your pay schedule answers it — and once it's set, you're locked into that rhythm.

Choose carefully. Changing pay schedules mid-year creates confusion, transition headaches, and sometimes angry employees who thought they were getting paid Friday but now have to wait until the 15th.

## Pay schedule types

| Schedule | Frequency | Pay periods/year | Best for |
|----------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| Weekly | Every week | 52 | Hourly workers, construction, restaurants |
| Bi-weekly | Every two weeks | 26 | Most common — good balance |
| Semi-monthly | 1st and 15th | 24 | Salaried employees, predictable dates |
| Monthly | Once per month | 12 | Executives, some states don't allow for hourly |

## Schedule details by type

### Weekly

| Setting | What it means |
|---------|-------------|
| Pay day | Usually Friday |
| Week ending | Last day of the work week (usually Sunday) |
| First pay date | When the first paycheck lands |

52 payrolls per year. More work for you, but employees get cash flow.

### Bi-weekly

| Setting | What it means |
|---------|-------------|
| Pay day | Usually Friday |
| Week 1 start | Defines which weeks are "pay weeks" |
| First pay date | Anchors the bi-weekly cycle |

26 pay periods. Twice a month feels consistent, but two months per year have 3 pay periods (employees love those months).

### Semi-monthly

| Setting | What it means |
|---------|-------------|
| First pay day | Usually the 15th |
| Second pay day | Usually the last day of month |
| Weekend adjustment | What happens when pay day falls on Saturday |

24 pay periods. Predictable dates every month, but hours don't divide evenly — awkward for hourly employees.

### Monthly

| Setting | What it means |
|---------|-------------|
| Pay day | Usually the 1st or last day of month |
| Weekend adjustment | Shift to Friday or Monday |

12 pay periods. Easiest for you, hardest for employees to budget. Some states restrict monthly pay for hourly workers.

## Weekend adjustments

When pay day lands on a weekend:

| Option | What happens |
|--------|----------|
| Previous Friday | Pay early |
| Following Monday | Pay late |
| Closest business day | Depends on the day |

Most companies choose "previous Friday." Employees prefer getting paid early over late.

## Holiday adjustments

When pay day falls on a bank holiday (Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.):

1. Define your company holidays in **Settings → Payroll → Holidays**
2. Choose how to handle conflicts
3. Pluvel adjusts automatically

Employees don't like being told their paycheck will arrive "sometime after the holiday."

## Multiple schedules

Many companies run different schedules for different groups:

| Group | Typical schedule | Why |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| Hourly employees | Weekly or bi-weekly | Cash flow matters, easier to track hours |
| Salaried employees | Semi-monthly | Consistent amounts, predictable dates |
| Executives | Monthly | Higher earners can budget longer |

You can have as many schedules as you need — but more schedules means more payroll runs.

## Assigning employees

Each employee belongs to exactly one schedule:

1. Open their profile
2. Go to **Compensation**
3. Select the pay schedule
4. Save

When you run payroll, you'll run it by schedule — everyone on "Bi-weekly Friday" gets processed together.

## The payroll calendar

See all your deadlines in one view:

1. Go to **Payroll → Calendar**
2. View pay dates across all schedules
3. See submission deadlines
4. Plan your week

Color-coded by schedule if you have multiple.

## Submission deadlines

To hit pay dates, submit payroll ahead of time:

| Pay date | Submit by |
|------------|-----------|
| Friday | Wednesday 5pm |
| 15th | 4 business days prior |
| Last day of month | 4 business days prior |

Miss the deadline and employees get paid late. They'll remember.

<Info>
Pluvel sends reminders before submission deadlines. But set your own calendar reminders too — don't leave it to chance.
</Info>

## Changing schedules

Changing someone's schedule mid-year:

1. Open their profile
2. Update the pay schedule
3. **Carefully** time the transition to avoid gaps or double-payments

If the old schedule paid on the 15th and the new one pays bi-weekly starting Monday, what happens in between? You need to think this through.

For company-wide schedule changes, plan months ahead and communicate clearly. Employees get anxious about anything that touches their paycheck timing.
