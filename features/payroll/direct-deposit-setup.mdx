Direct deposit gets paychecks into employee bank accounts automatically. No paper checks to print, sign, or distribute. Most employees prefer it, and it's easier for you.

## Setting Up Your Funding Account

Before employees can receive direct deposits, you need a bank account to fund them.

Go to **Settings → Payroll → Funding Account**.

You'll need:
- Bank name
- Routing number (9 digits)
- Account number
- Account type (checking is most common)

Pluvel verifies the account with test deposits — two small amounts (usually under $1) that you'll need to confirm.

<Info>
Verification takes 1-2 business days. You can't run payroll until the funding account is verified.
</Info>

## How Funding Works

When you run payroll:

1. **4 business days before check date** — We calculate the total payroll amount
2. **2 business days before** — We initiate a debit from your funding account
3. **Check date** — Money arrives in employee accounts

The 4-day lead time is required by the ACH network. Plan your payroll submissions accordingly.

## Employee Bank Accounts

Each employee needs their bank info on file.

**Employee self-service:** Employees log into Pluvel and enter their own bank details. They verify with micro-deposits, just like the company account.

**Admin entry:** You can enter bank info on behalf of employees. Go to the employee profile → Payroll → Direct Deposit.

Either way, bank info is encrypted and stored securely. Only designated admins can view full account numbers.

## Split Deposits

Employees can split their paycheck across multiple accounts:

- Send $500 to savings, rest to checking
- Send a fixed amount to one account, percentage to another
- Up to 3 deposit destinations

Employees set this up in their profile, or you can configure it for them.

## Verification Process

### Company Account

1. You enter bank details
2. Pluvel sends two micro-deposits (e.g., $0.12 and $0.34)
3. You log into your bank, find the deposits
4. Enter the amounts in Pluvel to verify

### Employee Accounts

Same process, but employees do it themselves:

1. Employee enters their bank info
2. We send micro-deposits
3. Employee confirms the amounts
4. Account is verified

Unverified employee accounts can't receive direct deposits. Payroll will issue them a paper check until they verify.

## Changing Bank Accounts

**Employee changes:** Employees can update their own bank info anytime. New accounts need verification. There's a brief hold period (usually 2 pay cycles) for security.

**Company changes:** Changing your funding account requires re-verification. Plan ahead — you can't run payroll during the verification period.

<Warning>
Be cautious of employee requests to change bank accounts right before payday, especially via email. This is a common fraud vector. Verify unusual requests through a separate channel.
</Warning>

## Paper Checks

If an employee can't or won't use direct deposit:

- They won't enter bank info (or you'll skip it)
- Pluvel generates a pay stub
- You print and sign a check manually
- Mark it as paid in Pluvel

Paper checks are tracked separately. You'll see which employees get checks vs. direct deposit on each payroll.

## Prenote Transactions

When you add a new bank account, Pluvel sends a "prenote" — a $0 test transaction to verify the account exists and routing is correct. This happens automatically during verification and catches errors before real money moves.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Micro-deposits didn't arrive">
    Check the routing and account numbers. If they're wrong, deposits go to the wrong place. If correct, wait 3-4 business days — some banks are slow. If still nothing, try a different verification method (instant verification via Plaid is available for some banks).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Payroll debit failed">
    This usually means insufficient funds or an account issue. We'll alert you immediately. You'll need to resolve it with your bank and potentially run a late payroll once the account is in good standing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Employee didn't receive their deposit">
    First, confirm the account is verified. Then check the payroll status — if it says "deposited," contact the employee's bank. Deposits can take 1-2 days to appear depending on the receiving bank.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use a savings account for funding?">
    Some savings accounts work, but many have transaction limits (often 6 per month under Regulation D). A checking account is safer for payroll funding.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security

Direct deposit involves moving money, so security matters:

- Bank info is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Only designated admins can view full account numbers
- Changes to bank info are logged in the audit trail
- Employees are notified when their bank info changes
- You can require two-factor auth for payroll operations
