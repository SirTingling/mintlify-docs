description: Add and manage employees for payroll.

You just hired someone. Now you need to get them into the system before their first paycheck — which means collecting a lot of information you probably don't have yet (their SSN, their W-4, their bank account). Welcome to onboarding.

The good news: once an employee is set up, payroll runs automatically. The tedious part is one-time.

  <Step title="Employment details">
    - Start date
    - Job title
    - Department

## Employee information

### Personal details

The basics you need for every employee:

| Field | Why it matters |
|-------|-------------|
| Legal name | Must match their SSN card exactly — one typo breaks tax filings |
| Preferred name | What they actually go by |
| Email | Where pay stubs and tax forms go |
| Phone | For urgent payroll questions |
| Address | Determines state tax withholding — wrong state = wrong taxes |
| DOB | Required for compliance |
| SSN | Everything ties to this. Triple-check it. |

### Employment details

| Field | Why it matters |
|-------|-------------|
| Start date | Triggers new hire reporting to the state |
| Job title | For your records and their pay stub |
| Department | Helps with cost analysis ("what's engineering costing us?") |
| Manager | For approval workflows |
| Work location | Affects tax jurisdiction if you have multiple offices |
| Status | Active, on leave, or terminated |

## Compensation

This is where money gets decided.

### Salaried employees

| Field | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| Annual salary | The number you agreed on |
| Per-period pay | Calculated automatically (annual ÷ pay periods) |
| Exempt status | Are they exempt from overtime? (FLSA classification) |

A $60,000 salary paid bi-weekly = $2,307.69 per paycheck (before deductions and taxes eat into it).

### Hourly employees

| Field | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| Hourly rate | What they earn per hour |
| Overtime rate | Usually 1.5x base (some states require 2x) |
| Default hours | Pre-fills each payroll, but you can adjust |

For hourly employees, you'll enter actual hours worked each pay period.

## Tax withholding

This is where most new employers get confused. The employee's W-4 tells you how much federal tax to withhold — and getting it wrong means they'll owe a big bill (or get a big refund) at tax time.

### Federal (W-4)

| Field | What it controls |
|-------|-------------|
| Filing status | Single, married, head of household |
| Multiple jobs | Checked if they (or spouse) have other jobs |
| Dependents | Reduces withholding per dependent |
| Additional withholding | "Take an extra $50 from each check" |

Don't worry about calculating anything. Enter what's on the W-4, and Pluvel does the math.

### State withholding

Every state is different. Some mirror the federal form, some have their own. Enter the state-specific info:
- State filing status
- State allowances
- Additional state withholding

<Info>
Employees can update their own W-4 information through self-service. You don't need to be in the loop for every life change.
</Info>

## Direct deposit

Most employees want direct deposit. Get their bank details:

### Single account

- Bank name
- Routing number (9 digits)
- Account number
- Account type (checking or savings)

### Split deposits

Some employees want to auto-save:
- "$500 to savings, rest to checking"
- "20% to emergency fund, 80% to checking"
- Up to 3 accounts

## Employee self-service

Let employees manage their own stuff:

- View and download pay stubs
- Update address and contact info
- Change direct deposit accounts
- Update W-4 withholding
- Download tax documents (W-2s)

Enable in **Settings → Payroll → Self-Service**. Fewer "can you send me my pay stub?" messages.

## Employee status

| Status | What happens |
|--------|---------|
| Active | Included in regular payroll runs |
| On leave | Temporarily excluded from payroll |
| Terminated | Removed from payroll, history preserved |

## Terminating an employee

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open their profile">
    Find the employee in the list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Terminate">
    Select **Terminate Employee**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter termination details">
    - Last day of work
    - Reason (voluntary, involuntary, etc.)
    - Final pay date
  </Step>

  <Step title="Process final pay">
    Run their last paycheck. Include:
    - Wages through their last day
    - PTO payout (if your policy requires it)
    - Any owed bonuses or commissions
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Some states require final pay within 24-72 hours of termination. California, for example, requires immediate payment for involuntary terminations. Know your state's rules.
