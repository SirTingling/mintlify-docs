When you hire someone, most states require you to report it. These "new hire reports" help the government track child support obligations and detect unemployment fraud. Pluvel files them automatically so you don't have to.

## What's Required

Within 20 days of an employee's start date (varies by state), you must report:

- Employee name and address
- Social Security number
- Employer name and address
- Federal EIN
- State employer ID

This isn't optional. Failing to report can result in fines — typically $25-$500 per employee depending on the state.

## How Pluvel Handles It

When you add a new employee with a start date:

1. Pluvel collects the required information during employee setup
2. On the start date (or shortly before), we file the report electronically
3. You get confirmation that it was submitted
4. If there's an issue, we alert you

You don't have to do anything manually. It's automatic.

<Info>
New hire reporting is included with payroll. If you're using Pluvel payroll, this happens automatically for every state where you have employees.

## Viewing Filed Reports

Go to **Finance → Payroll → Compliance → New Hire Reports** to see:

- All new hire reports filed
- Status (submitted, accepted, rejected)
- Filing date
- Employee name and state

Filter by date range or state to find specific filings.

## Multi-State Employers

If you have employees in multiple states, we file with each state separately. Every state has slightly different requirements and systems, but Pluvel handles the variations.

Some states (like California and New York) are strict about timing. Others are more relaxed. We file within the required window for each state.

## What Happens with the Data

States use new hire data primarily for:

**Child support enforcement** — Matching new hires against people who owe child support. If there's a match, you'll receive a wage withholding order.

**Unemployment verification** — Detecting people claiming unemployment while employed.

**Fraud prevention** — General cross-checking against benefit programs.

You're not responsible for what states do with the data. You're just required to report the hire.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I report contractors?">
    Generally no. New hire reporting is for W-2 employees. Contractors (1099) aren't reported through this system. However, some states require separate reporting for contractors — California has AB5 requirements, for example.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I rehire someone?">
    You need to report them again. If someone leaves and comes back later, they're a new hire. Pluvel handles this — every time you add a start date, we file.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if the employee starts before I finish setup?">
    Try to complete employee setup before or on their start date. If you're a few days late, Pluvel will still file immediately — most states won't penalize small delays. Just don't wait weeks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I got a child support order. What now?">
    If a state matches your new hire to a child support case, they'll send you a wage withholding order. You must withhold the specified amount from each paycheck. Pluvel handles the withholding automatically once you enter the order in the employee's deductions.

## States Without Electronic Filing

A few states still use paper forms or have limited electronic filing. For these states, Pluvel generates the form and either:

- Faxes it (yes, some states still use fax)
- Mails it
- Alerts you to file manually with a pre-filled form

We're always adding electronic filing as states modernize their systems.

## Troubleshooting

**Report rejected:** Usually means missing or incorrect data (invalid SSN, bad address format). We'll alert you with the specific issue. Fix the employee record and we'll refile.

**Late filing:** If an employee's start date passes without required info, you'll see a warning. Complete their profile ASAP to minimize late filing risk.

**State not responding:** Some state systems have delays. "Pending" status is normal for a few days. If it's been over a week with no confirmation, we'll flag it.

<Warning>
Make sure employee SSNs are correct. Incorrect SSNs cause rejection and can create issues with tax filings later. Verify against the employee's Social Security card if possible.
</Warning>
