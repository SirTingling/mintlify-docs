"Where did my money go?" is the most common payroll question. Pay stubs answer it — showing exactly what an employee earned, what came out for taxes and deductions, and what landed in their bank account.

Every payroll run generates pay stubs automatically. Here's what's on them.

## Pay stub contents

### Earnings (what they made)

| Line item | What it is |
|------|-------------|
| Regular pay | Hours × rate (hourly) or period salary |
| Overtime | Hours over 40 × overtime rate |
| Bonus | Performance, holiday, signing bonuses |
| Commission | Sales commissions |
| Other | Reimbursements, tips, etc. |
| **Gross pay** | Everything added up (before anything comes out) |

### Deductions (what came out)

| Line item | What it is |
|------|-------------|
| Federal income tax | Based on W-4 withholding |
| State income tax | Based on state withholding form |
| Social Security | 6.2% of wages (up to limit) |
| Medicare | 1.45% of all wages |
| Health insurance | Pre-tax premium |
| 401(k) | Retirement contributions |
| Other deductions | Anything else coming out |
| **Net pay** | What actually hits their bank account |

### Year-to-date totals

Every pay stub shows running totals for the year:
- YTD gross pay
- YTD taxes withheld (federal, state, FICA)
- YTD deductions
- YTD net pay

Useful for tax planning. "How much have I paid in taxes so far this year?"

Employees can access their own history through self-service.

## Customizing pay stubs

### Your branding

Make stubs look official:

1. Go to **Settings → Payroll → Pay Stubs**
2. Upload your company logo
3. Add company address and contact info

### Privacy settings

Control what appears on stubs:

| Setting | Options |
|--------|-----------|
| Employee SSN | Full, last 4 only, or hidden |
| Bank account | Full, last 4 only, or hidden |
| Company address | Show or hide |
| PTO balances | Show or hide |

Most companies show last 4 digits only for security.

## State requirements

Some states mandate specific information on pay stubs:

| State | What they require |
|-------|--------------|
| California | Detailed itemization including hours, rates, deductions, employer name/address |
| New York | Gross/net wages, deductions, rate of pay |
| Most states | Basic earning and deduction information |

Pluvel automatically formats stubs to meet your state's requirements. You don't need to think about this.

## Pay stub errors

If something's wrong on a pay stub:

1. Identify the error (wrong hours? missing bonus?)
2. Correct it on the next regular payroll, or
3. Run an off-cycle correction payroll
4. New stub generates with the correction

<Info>
Original stubs are never deleted — corrections appear as separate entries. This preserves the audit trail.

## Common employee questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| "Why is my net pay less than last time?" | Check if deductions changed (benefits, 401k) or if hours were different |
| "What's OASDI?" | Social Security tax (sometimes labeled differently) |
| "Why did my tax withholding change?" | You may have hit an annual limit, or your W-4 settings changed |
