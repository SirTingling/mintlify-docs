An employee's gross pay is never what they take home. Between taxes (which you can't avoid) and deductions (which are often voluntary), a $5,000 paycheck might become $3,200 by the time it hits their bank account.

Deductions cover benefits, retirement contributions, garnishments, and anything else that comes out of their pay before or after taxes.

## Deduction types

### Pre-tax deductions

These come out *before* taxes are calculated — meaning they reduce taxable income. Employees pay less in taxes when they use pre-tax benefits.

| Type | Common examples |
|------|----------|
| Health insurance | Medical, dental, vision premiums |
| HSA contributions | Health Savings Account deposits |
| FSA contributions | Flexible Spending Account deposits |
| 401(k) traditional | Pre-tax retirement savings |
| Commuter benefits | Transit passes, parking |

### Post-tax deductions

These come out *after* taxes are calculated — the employee has already paid income tax on this money.

| Type | Common examples |
|------|----------|
| Roth 401(k) | After-tax retirement (tax-free withdrawals later) |
| Life insurance | Employer-paid amounts over $50k are taxable |
| Garnishments | Court-ordered child support, tax levies, creditor judgments |
| Union dues | If applicable |
| Charitable donations | Payroll giving programs |

## Setting up deductions

### Company-level setup

First, create the deduction types your company offers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings → Payroll → Deductions**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a deduction type">
    Click **Add Deduction Type**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure it">
    - Name (e.g., "Medical Insurance - Employee")
    - Pre-tax or post-tax
    - Category (health, retirement, other)
    - How to calculate (fixed, percentage, per hour)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Now you can assign this deduction to employees.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Employee-level assignment

Each employee opts into (or is assigned) specific deductions:

1. Open the employee's profile
2. Go to **Deductions**
3. Click **Add Deduction**
4. Select the type and enter their specific amount
5. Save

Different employees can have different amounts — one might contribute 6% to 401(k), another might contribute 10%.

## Calculation methods

| Method | How it works | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Fixed amount | Same dollar amount each period | $200/paycheck for health insurance |
| Percentage | Percent of gross pay | 6% of gross to 401(k) |
| Per hour | Amount times hours worked | Union dues at $0.50/hour |
| Annual limit | Stops when limit is reached | 401(k) stops at $23,000 |

### Percentage example

Employee contributes 6% to 401(k):
- Gross pay this period: $5,000
- 401(k) deduction: $300

Next period the gross might be different (overtime, bonus), and the deduction adjusts automatically.

### Annual limits

The IRS caps certain deductions:

| Type | 2025 Limit |
|------|------------|
| 401(k) traditional/Roth | $23,000 ($30,500 if 50+) |
| HSA (individual) | $4,150 |
| HSA (family) | $8,300 |
| FSA | $3,200 |

Pluvel tracks year-to-date totals and automatically stops deductions when an employee hits the limit. No action needed from you.

## Employer contributions

Many benefits include an employer contribution:

| Benefit | Typical employer contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| 401(k) | 50% match on first 6% (employee contributes 6%, you add 3%) |
| HSA | Fixed amount per month ($50-100 common) |
| Health insurance | 50-80% of premium |

Set up employer portions in the deduction settings. They appear on the payroll summary as employer cost — not deducted from the employee.

## Garnishments

You just received a court order requiring you to withhold money from an employee's paycheck. This isn't optional.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive the order">
    It arrives by mail — from a court, state agency, or the IRS.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the garnishment">
    Set up the deduction with:
    - Type (child support, tax levy, creditor judgment)
    - Amount or percentage (as specified in the order)
    - Maximum per pay period (some have caps)
    - End date (if the order specifies one)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Withhold automatically">
    Every payroll, the amount comes out.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the money">
    Pay to the agency or recipient specified in the order, on the schedule they require.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Garnishment priority

When an employee has multiple garnishments, federal law dictates the order:

1. **Child support** — always first
2. **Tax levies** — IRS and state tax
3. **Other creditors** — credit cards, judgments, etc.

And there are limits on how much total can be garnished (typically 25-50% of disposable income).

<Warning>
Follow garnishment orders exactly as written. Failing to garnish (or garnishing wrong) can make you personally liable. When in doubt, consult an employment attorney.
</Warning>

## Effective dates

Deductions can be scheduled:

- **Start date** — When the deduction begins (new hire, open enrollment)
- **End date** — When it stops (employee leaves plan, garnishment satisfied)
- **Change effective date** — When an amount change takes effect

Set these in advance. During open enrollment, you might set new rates to start January 1 even though it's November.
