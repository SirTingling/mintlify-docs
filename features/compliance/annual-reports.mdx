Every year (or every two years in some states), your state wants to hear from you. Are you still in business? Same address? Same registered agent? Same people in charge?

That's what an annual report is — a required filing that keeps your company information current. Miss it and you'll pay late fees. Ignore it long enough and the state can dissolve your company.

## What an annual report does

An annual report (sometimes called "statement of information" or "annual registration"):

- Updates your company information on record
- Confirms your registered agent
- Lists current officers or managers
- Maintains your good standing status

<Warning>
Failure to file leads to penalties, late fees, and eventually administrative dissolution. Your company can lose its legal standing — meaning you lose liability protection.

## What information is required

Typical annual report asks for:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Company name | Legal name on file |
| Principal address | Where you conduct business |
| Mailing address | Where you receive mail |
| Registered agent | Agent name and address |
| Officers/Managers | Names and addresses of officers (corps) or managers (LLCs) |

### Updating information

If your information changed during the year:

1. Update it in **Company → Details**
2. Changes flow to your annual report automatically
3. The state updates their records when you file

## Annual report statuses

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| Upcoming | Due date more than 30 days away |
| Due Soon | Due within 30 days — time to prepare |
| In Review | Submitted, waiting for state acceptance |
| Filed | Accepted by the state — you're done |
| Overdue | Past due date, late fees may apply |

## What if you're late?

If your annual report is overdue:

1. Go to **Compliance → Annual Reports**
2. Click the overdue filing
3. File immediately (late fees included if applicable)

### Late fee examples

| State | Late Fee |
|-------|----------|
| Delaware | $200 + 1.5%/month interest |
| California | $250 |
| Wyoming | $50 (or loss of good standing) |
| Florida | $400 |

### What happens if you keep ignoring it

1. **Warning:** State sends notices
2. **Penalty:** Late fees assessed
3. **Revoked:** Good standing lost
4. **Dissolution:** Company administratively dissolved

Reinstatement is possible but expensive and time-consuming. Don't let it get to this point.

## Good standing certificates

After filing your annual report, you can order a Certificate of Good Standing:

1. Go to **Company → Documents**
2. Click **Order Certificate of Good Standing**
3. State issues certificate (usually within 24-48 hours)
4. Download from your documents

Good standing certificates are often required for:
- Opening bank accounts
- Applying for loans
- Signing contracts
- Registering in other states

## Multi-state filings

If you're registered in multiple states:

- Each state has its own annual report
- Due dates may differ
- We track all states in your compliance calendar

Go to **Compliance → Annual Reports** to see filings for all states where you're registered.

## Historical filings

1. Go to **Company → Documents → Annual Reports**
2. See all filed reports
3. Download copies as needed
