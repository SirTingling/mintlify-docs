You missed a deadline because the reminder email landed in your spam folder. Or because you get so many emails that one more got ignored. Or because you saw it, thought "I'll handle that later," and forgot.

Sound familiar?

Compliance notifications exist for one reason: to make sure deadlines are impossible to miss. But notifications only work if they fit how you actually work. Some people want a single weekly digest. Others want daily reminders starting 90 days out. We let you configure what works for you.

## Notification channels

| Type | Channel | Best for |
|------|---------|----------|
| Email | Your inbox | Primary notifications |
| Push | Mobile app | Urgent items when you're away from your desk |
| In-app | Dashboard | Always visible when you're in Pluvel |
| Calendar | Synced calendar | Seeing deadlines alongside meetings |

## What you get by default

Out of the box, here's when you'll hear from us:

| Time Before Due | Email | Push | Dashboard |
|-----------------|-------|------|-----------|
| 60 days | ✓ | | ✓ |
| 30 days | ✓ | | ✓ |
| 14 days | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 7 days | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Day of | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Past due | Daily | ✓ | ✓ |

Most people find this works well. But if it doesn't, change it.

## Customizing your notifications

Go to **Settings → Compliance → Notifications** to adjust.

### Different schedules for different deadlines

Not all compliance items are equally complex. Filing an annual report takes 5 minutes. Shopping for new insurance takes weeks. Set different lead times accordingly:

| Category | When we start reminding | Frequent reminders start |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Annual reports | 90 days | 30 days |
| Tax filings | 60 days | 14 days |
| License renewals | 60 days | 30 days |
| Registered agent | 45 days | 14 days |

### Urgency levels

Adjust how aggressively we remind you:

| Urgency | What it means |
|---------|-------------|
| Normal | Standard reminder schedule |
| Important | More frequent reminders |
| Critical | Daily reminders starting 30 days out |
| Quiet | Minimal notifications (for items you track elsewhere) |

## Email settings

### Choose your frequency

| Option | How it works |
|--------|----------|
| Individual | One email per deadline, per reminder interval |
| Daily digest | One email each morning with everything due soon |
| Weekly digest | One email each Monday |

Digest mode is great if you're drowning in email. You get one summary instead of five separate reminders.

### When digests send

- **Daily digest:** 8 AM your local time
- **Weekly digest:** Monday at 8 AM

### What's in each email

Every compliance email includes:

- Deadline name and due date
- Days remaining
- One-click link to take action
- When you last filed (if applicable)

## Push notifications

Push notifications go to the Pluvel mobile app. Install the app to receive them.

### When you'll get push alerts

- Urgent deadlines (within 7 days)
- Past due items
- Filing confirmations

### Quiet hours

Don't want compliance alerts at 11 PM? Set quiet hours:

1. Go to **Settings → Notifications → Quiet Hours**
2. Set start and end times
3. Push notifications wait until quiet hours end

<Info>
Truly urgent items (past due, same day) may still send during quiet hours. If that's a problem, you can disable even urgent notifications in settings.
</Info>

## Dashboard alerts

Even if you ignore every email, the dashboard keeps track.

The compliance widget shows:

- Deadlines due within 30 days
- Overdue items (always visible until resolved)
- Recently filed items

### Alert badges

Red badges appear on:

- Sidebar navigation (Compliance menu item)
- Dashboard compliance card
- Notification bell icon

Badges clear when you view or resolve the item. They're designed to catch your eye, not nag you indefinitely.

## Team notifications

### Who gets what

| Role | What they receive |
|------|------------------|
| Owner | All compliance notifications |
| Admin | All compliance notifications |
| Accountant | Tax-related deadlines only |
| Team Member | Only items assigned to them |

### When you assign a deadline

1. The assignee receives all notifications for that item
2. You (owner) still get copies
3. Assignment is noted in the notification

### Adding multiple recipients

For critical deadlines, add extra eyes:

1. Click the deadline
2. Go to **Notifications**
3. Add team members
4. Each person receives their own notifications

Good for things like annual reports where missing the deadline affects everyone.

## Notification history

Not sure if you received a reminder? Check the log:

1. Go to **Settings → Compliance → Notification History**
2. View sent notifications
3. Filter by date, type, or recipient

Useful for settling "I never got that email" discussions.

## Do Not Disturb mode

Going on vacation? Pause compliance notifications:

1. Go to **Settings → Compliance → Notifications**
2. Enable **Do Not Disturb**
3. Set an end date
4. Notifications resume automatically

<Warning>
The deadlines don't pause — just the notifications. Make sure nothing critical is due during your quiet period.
</Warning>

## Escalation for past-due items

If something slips through, notifications get more aggressive:

| Days Past Due | What happens |
|---------------|-------------|
| 1-3 | Daily email reminders |
| 4-7 | Daily email + push notifications |
| 8+ | Multiple daily reminders, owner always CC'd |

This is intentional. Past-due compliance items can have serious consequences (late fees, loss of good standing, personal liability). We'd rather be annoying than let you get hurt.

## External notifications

### Keep your accountant in the loop

Add your accountant to compliance notifications:

1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Invite your accountant with Accountant role
3. They receive tax-related compliance notifications automatically

### CC someone on all compliance emails

Have an assistant or partner who should see everything?

1. Go to **Settings → Compliance → Notifications**
2. Add CC email addresses
3. All compliance emails include these recipients
