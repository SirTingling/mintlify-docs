Your registered agent bill came due. So did your general liability insurance. And that city business license you forgot existed? Also due. Last month you paid three late fees because the renewal emails got buried in your inbox.

Business renewals are death by a thousand cuts. Not individually expensive, but miss enough of them and you're bleeding money on late fees — or worse, operating without required coverage.

The renewals dashboard puts everything in one view so you stop playing whack-a-mole with due dates.

## What gets tracked

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Registered agent | Annual service renewal |
| Business licenses | City, county, state permits |
| State registrations | Foreign qualifications, DBAs |
| Insurance | General liability, E&O, workers' comp |
| Subscriptions | Software, services you pay annually |
| Domains | Company domain names |

## Viewing your renewals

Go to **Compliance → Renewals** to see everything in one list.

| Column | What it shows |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | What's renewing |
| Category | License, Registration, Insurance, etc. |
| Provider | Who you pay |
| Amount | Renewal cost |
| Next Due | Renewal date |
| Status | Current, Due Soon, Past Due |

### Filtering

Find what matters right now:

- **By status:** Current, Due within 30/60/90 days, Past due
- **By category:** Licenses, Insurance, Subscriptions
- **By month:** See what's due in a specific month

## The timeline view

See your renewals laid out chronologically:

```
March 2025
├── Mar 1: Delaware Annual Report - $225
├── Mar 15: General Liability Insurance - $2,400/yr
└── Mar 28: City Business License - $150

April 2025
├── Apr 10: Registered Agent (Wyoming) - $99
└── Apr 30: Domain renewal (pluvel.com) - $15
```

This view makes it obvious when you've got three things due in the same week versus months of nothing.

Go to **Compliance → Renewals → Timeline** for this view.

## What we track automatically

| Source | Auto-Tracked |
|--------|--------------|
| Pluvel registered agent | ✓ |
| Company formation dates | ✓ |
| Known licensing deadlines | ✓ |
| Manually added items | You add them |

We can't track your insurance policies or software subscriptions automatically — those you'll need to add yourself. Takes about 30 seconds per item.

## Adding a renewal

1. Click **Add Renewal**
2. Enter:
   - Name (e.g., "Office Lease")
   - Category
   - Provider/vendor
   - Amount
   - Renewal frequency (annual, quarterly, monthly)
   - Next due date
3. Save

### Recurring schedules

| Frequency | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Annual | Insurance policies, licenses |
| Semi-annual | Some inspections |
| Quarterly | Quarterly tax estimates |
| Monthly | Subscriptions |

When you mark something as renewed, we automatically schedule the next one based on frequency. No need to remember to update it every year.

## Reminder schedule

| Time Before | How we remind you |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 60 days | Email |
| 30 days | Email + dashboard alert |
| 14 days | Email + push notification |
| 7 days | Daily reminders |

### Customizing reminders

Some renewals need more lead time than others. Insurance shopping takes longer than clicking "renew" on a domain.

1. Click the renewal
2. Go to **Reminder Settings**
3. Set your preferred advance notice

## Processing renewals

### What Pluvel handles

For registered agent renewals and some state filings:

1. Click **Renew Now**
2. Confirm the charge
3. We process the renewal
4. Confirmation saved to your documents

That's it. No logging into another site, no hunting for your password.

### What you handle

For external renewals (insurance, licenses, subscriptions):

1. Complete the renewal with the provider
2. Come back to Pluvel
3. Click **Mark as Renewed**
4. Update the next due date

This keeps your records accurate even for things we can't process directly.

## Seeing your renewal costs

### Annual projection

See what you're spending on renewals by year:

| Category | 2025 | 2026 |
|----------|------|------|
| Registered Agent | $99 | $99 |
| State Filings | $450 | $450 |
| Licenses | $300 | $300 |
| Insurance | $3,600 | $3,800 |
| **Total** | **$4,449** | **$4,649** |

No more "where did $4,000 go?" at year end. Go to **Compliance → Renewals → Costs** for the full breakdown.

### Budget planning

Export renewal projections for your accountant or bookkeeper:

1. Go to **Compliance → Renewals → Costs**
2. Click **Export**
3. Download as CSV or PDF

## Grace periods

Many renewals have grace periods — time after the due date before things get serious:

| Item | Typical Grace Period |
|------|---------------------|
| State annual reports | 30-60 days (with late fees) |
| Business licenses | Varies by city |
| Insurance | 10-30 days |
| Registered agent | None (service may lapse) |

<Warning>
Don't rely on grace periods. Late renewals mean fees, and some (like registered agent) have no cushion at all. If service lapses, you could miss important legal documents.
</Warning>

## When renewals go past due

If a renewal payment fails or you miss the deadline:

1. The item shows as "Past Due" in red
2. You receive urgent notifications
3. Instructions for resolving appear

### Common reasons

- Payment method expired
- Insufficient funds
- Renewal email got buried

### Getting back on track

1. Click the past-due item
2. Follow instructions to renew
3. Pay any late fees
4. Update the record when resolved

## Storing renewal documents

Keep confirmations, receipts, and certificates with each renewal:

1. Click the renewal
2. Go to **Documents**
3. Upload confirmations, receipts, certificates

Everything is also accessible in **Company → Documents** if you need to find it later.

## Delegating renewals

Not everything needs to flow through you. Assign renewals to team members:

1. Click the renewal
2. Click **Assign**
3. Select a team member
4. They receive reminders and can mark as renewed

Useful if you have an office manager or assistant handling administrative tasks.
