Running a business means keeping track of deadlines you didn't know existed. Annual reports. Franchise taxes. License renewals. BOI updates. Miss one and you're paying late fees — or worse, losing your good standing.

The compliance calendar puts every deadline in one view. You'll know what's due, when it's due, and what happens if you miss it.

## What the calendar tracks

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| State filings | Annual reports, BOI report, franchise tax |
| Registered agent | Service renewals |
| Business licenses | City/county permits, professional licenses |
| Tax deadlines | Quarterly estimates, payroll filings, sales tax |
| Corporate governance | Meeting minutes, officer elections |

## Viewing your calendar

Go to **Compliance** in the sidebar to see your calendar.
