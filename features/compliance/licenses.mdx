Beyond state registration, many businesses need local licenses and professional permits. A general business license from your city. A seller's permit for sales tax. Maybe a professional license for your industry.

Pluvel doesn't issue these licenses — that's between you and the issuing authority. But we help you track what you have, when it expires, and when you need to renew.

## Types of licenses

| Type | Examples | Who issues it |
|------|----------|---------------|
| General business | Business license, business tax certificate | City/County |
| Professional | Contractor license, CPA license | State board |
| Industry-specific | Food handler permit, liquor license | State/Local |
| Home-based | Home occupation permit | City |
| Federal | FCC license, ATF permit | Federal agency |

## License list

Go to **Compliance → Licenses** to see:

| Column | What it shows |
|--------|---------------|
| Name | License type and description |
| Issuer | City, county, state, or federal agency |
| Number | Your license number |
| Status | Active, Expiring Soon, Expired |
| Expires | Expiration date |

### Filtering

- Filter by status: Active, Expiring, Expired
- Sort by expiration date
- Search by name or number

## Renewal reminders

We remind you before licenses expire:

| Time Before | How we notify you |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 90 days | Email reminder |
| 60 days | Email + dashboard alert |
| 30 days | Email + push notification |
| 7 days | Daily reminders |

### Customizing reminders

Change reminder timing for specific licenses:

1. Click the license
2. Go to **Reminder Settings**
3. Set your preferred intervals

## Renewal process

When a license is due for renewal:

1. You receive reminders
2. Click the license to see renewal instructions
3. Complete renewal through the issuing authority (not Pluvel)
4. Update the license in Pluvel with the new expiration date

<Info>
Pluvel tracks and reminds you about licenses but doesn't file renewals. Local licensing requirements vary too much for automated filing — each city and county has their own process.
</Info>

### After renewing

1. Go to **Compliance → Licenses**
2. Click the renewed license
3. Click **Mark as Renewed**
4. Enter new expiration date
5. Upload new license document

## License requirements by location

### City business licenses

Most cities require a general business license:

- Required to legally operate in the city
- Annual fee (typically $50-$500)
- May require zoning approval
- Usually tied to your business address

### County permits

Some counties have their own requirements:

- Business personal property tax registration
- Health department permits
- Fire safety inspections

### State professional licenses

If your profession is regulated:

- Contractor licenses (general, specialty)
- Real estate licenses
- Professional licenses (CPA, attorney, engineer)
- Healthcare licenses

## Compliance status

See your overall license compliance:

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| ✓ Compliant | All licenses current |
| ⚠ Attention | License expiring within 60 days |
| ✗ Non-compliant | Expired license |

View status in **Dashboard → Compliance** or **Compliance → Overview**.

## Tracking license costs

Track what you spend on licensing:

1. When adding or renewing, enter the fee
2. Go to **Compliance → Licenses → Costs**
3. See annual licensing expenses

This helps with budgeting and tax deductions — licensing fees are typically deductible.

## Multi-location businesses

If you have multiple locations:

- Add the location when creating each license
- Filter by location in the license list
- See location-specific compliance status

### Example

A restaurant chain with 3 locations might have:

- 3 city business licenses (one per location)
- 3 health department permits
- 3 fire safety certificates
- 1-3 liquor licenses (if applicable)

## License documents

Store license documents in Pluvel:

1. Click the license
2. Upload documents:
   - License certificate
   - Renewal receipts
   - Inspection reports
   - Application materials

Documents are stored with the license record and accessible in **Company → Documents → Licenses**.

## Expired license handling

If a license expires:

1. It shows as "Expired" in red
2. You receive alerts
3. The license remains in your list (not auto-deleted)

### Reinstatement

Many licenses can be reinstated after expiration:

- Grace period varies by license
- Late fees may apply
- May require re-inspection

Check with the issuing authority for their reinstatement procedures.
