Not every account connects via Plaid. Your local credit union might not be supported. Your foreign business account definitely isn't. And good luck connecting your petty cash drawer.

Manual accounts let you track these in Pluvel anyway. Import transactions via CSV or enter them by hand. Same categorization, same reports, same reconciliation — just without the automatic sync.

## When you need a manual account

- Banks not supported by Plaid
- Foreign bank accounts
- Investment accounts
- Petty cash
- PayPal or Stripe (if you prefer CSV over integration)
- Loan accounts

## Creating a manual account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Banking">
    Navigate to **Banking → Accounts**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Add Account">
    Select **Add Manual Account**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter details">
    Fill in:
    - Account name
    - Account type (checking, savings, credit card, etc.)
    - Starting balance
    - As-of date
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    The account appears in your account list.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Importing transactions

### CSV import

Import transactions from a downloaded bank statement:

1. Open the manual account
2. Click **Import Transactions**
3. Upload your CSV file
4. Map columns to fields (date, description, amount)
5. Review the import preview
6. Confirm import

### Supported formats

- CSV (comma-separated)
- Excel (.xlsx)
- OFX/QFX (from many banks)
- QBO (QuickBooks format)

If your bank offers a download option, it probably works.

### Column mapping

Map your file's columns to Pluvel fields:

| Pluvel field | Your column might be called |
|--------------|-------------|
| Date | Transaction Date, Posted Date |
| Description | Description, Memo, Payee |
| Amount | Amount, Debit/Credit |
| Reference | Check Number, Reference |

For files with separate debit and credit columns, select both. We'll figure it out.

## Manual entry

When you only have a few transactions (or for petty cash):

1. Open the account
2. Click **Add Transaction**
3. Enter:
   - Date
   - Description
   - Amount (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals)
   - Category (optional)
4. Save

## Updating balances

For manual accounts, update the balance periodically to catch discrepancies:

1. Open the account
2. Click **Update Balance**
3. Enter current balance and as-of date
4. Any difference creates a reconciliation adjustment

<Tip>
Update manual account balances at least monthly. Finding a $50 discrepancy is annoying. Finding a $500 discrepancy from six months ago is worse.
</Tip>

## Reconciliation

Reconcile manual accounts just like connected ones:

1. Get your bank statement
2. Go to **Banking → Reconciliation**
3. Select the manual account
4. Enter statement ending balance
5. Clear transactions that appear on the statement
6. Complete when balanced

Same process, same verification.

## Converting to connected

If your bank becomes available via Plaid (or if Plaid starts supporting it):

1. Connect the account via Plaid
2. Pluvel matches it to your manual account
3. Future transactions import automatically
4. Historical manual transactions remain

You don't lose anything — you just stop doing data entry.

## Making this less painful

- **Import weekly or monthly** — Don't let it build up
- **Use the same CSV format each time** — Column mapping saves
- **Reconcile regularly** — Monthly at minimum
- **Keep your statements** — Store them as attachments in Pluvel

Manual accounts are more work than connected ones. But some accounts are worth tracking even if it takes effort.
