Transactions flow in from your connected bank accounts. Now what?

You need to categorize them (office supplies vs. software vs. that lunch you're not sure counts as a business expense). You need to spot the duplicates. You need to attach receipts so you're not scrambling during tax season.

This is where that work happens.

## The transaction feed

View transactions in **Banking → Transactions**:

| Column | What you see |
|--------|-------------|
| Date | When the transaction posted |
| Description | Merchant name or memo |
| Amount | Transaction amount |
| Account | Which bank account |
| Category | Assigned category |
| Status | Review status |

## Filtering transactions

### Quick filters

- **Needs Review** — Uncategorized transactions (start here)
- **All** — Everything
- **Income** — Deposits and credits
- **Expenses** — Withdrawals and debits
- **Transfers** — Between your accounts

### Advanced filters

Narrow down by:
- Date range
- Account
- Category
- Amount range
- Description search

Useful when you're looking for that one transaction from three months ago.

## Transaction details

Click any transaction to see:

- Full description
- Original bank memo
- Category assignment
- Attached receipts
- Notes
- Audit trail (who changed what, when)

## Categorizing transactions

### One at a time

1. Click the transaction
2. Select a category from the dropdown
3. Add notes if helpful
4. Save

### In bulk

For similar transactions (like 20 transactions from the same vendor):

1. Check multiple transactions
2. Click **Categorize**
3. Choose the category
4. Apply to all selected

### Auto-categorization

Pluvel learns from your patterns:

- Previously categorized vendors
- Bank rules you've created
- Common transaction types

Suggested categories appear with a confidence indicator. High confidence means it's probably right. Low confidence means double-check.

## Bank rules

Create rules so you don't categorize the same vendor 50 times:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Categorize a transaction">
    Assign it to the correct category.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create rule">
    Click **Create Rule** when saving.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set conditions">
    Match on:
    - Description contains "X"
    - Amount equals/greater/less than
    - Account is
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save rule">
    Future matching transactions auto-categorize.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Manage rules in **Settings → Banking → Bank Rules**.

## Transaction statuses

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------|
| Pending | Not yet categorized — needs your attention |
| Categorized | Assigned to an account |
| Reviewed | Verified by you or your bookkeeper |
| Excluded | Hidden from reports |
| Duplicate | Marked as duplicate |

## Splitting transactions

Sometimes one transaction covers multiple categories. Office supplies and that printer you bought. Or a meal that was half business, half personal.

1. Click the transaction
2. Click **Split**
3. Add line items with amounts and categories
4. Ensure total equals original amount
5. Save

## Handling duplicates

If the same transaction appears twice (it happens):

1. Click one of the duplicates
2. Click **Mark as Duplicate**
3. Select the original transaction
4. Duplicate is hidden from reports

Your books stay accurate without deleting anything.

## Excluding transactions

For transactions that shouldn't appear in your business reports (personal expenses that accidentally went through your business account):

1. Click the transaction
2. Click **Exclude**
3. Choose reason (personal, duplicate, error)

Excluded transactions remain visible for reference but don't affect financial reports.

## Attaching receipts

Add supporting documents for the transactions that need them:

1. Open the transaction
2. Click **Add Receipt**
3. Upload image or PDF
4. Or forward receipts to your unique Pluvel email address

Receipts are stored with the transaction. When your accountant asks for backup on that $2,400 equipment purchase, you'll have it.
