Your bank says you have $47,832.16. Pluvel says you have $48,106.44. Who's right?

Reconciliation answers that question. You compare your records to your bank statement, line by line, until the numbers match. It catches errors, missing transactions, and those duplicates that snuck in.

Yes, even with automatic bank feeds. Especially with automatic bank feeds.

## Why reconciliation matters

Even with automatic sync, things go wrong:

- **Duplicate imports** — The same transaction appears twice
- **Missing transactions** — Bank fees, interest, or manual transactions you forgot
- **Timing differences** — Pending transactions that posted differently than expected
- **Data errors** — Occasionally, Plaid sends wrong data

Reconciliation catches all of this before it becomes a bigger problem. Your accountant will reconcile anyway — better to do it now than explain discrepancies at tax time.

## Starting reconciliation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your bank statement">
    Download or access your statement for the period you're reconciling. PDF or paper both work.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Reconciliation">
    Navigate to **Banking → Reconciliation**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select account">
    Choose the account to reconcile.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter statement info">
    Enter the statement ending date and ending balance (exactly as shown on the statement).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start">
    Click **Start Reconciliation**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The reconciliation screen

| Section | What it shows |
|---------|---------|
| Statement balance | The ending balance from your bank statement |
| Cleared balance | Sum of transactions you've marked as cleared |
| Difference | Amount remaining to match (goal: $0.00) |
| Transactions | List of transactions to clear |

## Clearing transactions

For each transaction on your bank statement:

1. Find it in the Pluvel list
2. Check the box to mark it as cleared
3. Watch the difference decrease

When "Difference" reaches $0.00, you're balanced.

### Auto-matching

Pluvel automatically matches:
- Identical amounts and dates
- Similar amounts within a few days
- Previously matched recurring transactions

Auto-matched transactions show a green checkmark. You can override if it's wrong.

## Common discrepancies

### Transaction in Pluvel but not on statement

- **Timing** — It may appear on next statement (leave uncleared)
- **Not yet posted** — Bank hasn't processed it yet
- **Error** — Transaction was entered incorrectly (investigate)

### Transaction on statement but not in Pluvel

- **Sync delay** — Click "Sync Now" and refresh
- **Missing from feed** — Add manually
- **Bank fee or interest** — These often don't import automatically, add as new transaction

Click **Add Transaction** during reconciliation to add missing items on the spot.

## Making adjustments

For small unexplained differences (a few cents or dollars):

1. Click **Add Adjustment**
2. Enter amount
3. Select adjustment account (usually "Bank Adjustments" or "Rounding")
4. Add explanation note

<Warning>
Only adjust small amounts after investigation. A $200 difference isn't rounding error — it's a real problem that needs real investigation.
</Warning>

## Completing reconciliation

When the difference is $0.00:

1. Click **Complete Reconciliation**
2. Add any notes (optional)
3. Confirm

Reconciled transactions get locked. The reconciliation creates a record with:
- Date completed
- Who completed it
- Statement balance verified
- All cleared transactions

This is your audit trail.

## Reconciliation history

View past reconciliations:

1. Go to **Banking → Reconciliation → History**
2. See all completed reconciliations
3. Click to view details

If your accountant or auditor needs proof you reconciled January 2024, it's there.

## Undoing a reconciliation

If you made a mistake:

1. Go to reconciliation history
2. Click the reconciliation
3. Click **Unreconcile**

This reopens all transactions from that period. Use carefully — you'll need to re-reconcile.

## Reconciliation status

Track which accounts are current:

| Account | Last Reconciled | Status |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Checking | Jan 31 | Current |
| Savings | Jan 31 | Current |
| Credit Card | Dec 31 | Behind |

View in **Banking → Reconciliation → Overview**. Red means you're behind.

## Making reconciliation less painful

- **Do it monthly** — Don't let months build up
- **Use statement dates** — Match your bank's statement periods
- **Document adjustments** — Future you will want to know why
- **Reconcile before month-end close** — Required for accurate financial statements

Reconciliation takes 10-15 minutes per account when you do it monthly. Let it slide and it takes hours.
