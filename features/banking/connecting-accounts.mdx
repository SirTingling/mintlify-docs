You're still manually downloading CSV files from your bank every week. Then uploading them. Then matching transactions you've already categorized three times before.

Or maybe you're entering transactions by hand, hoping you don't miss anything.

Connect your bank accounts once and that busywork disappears. Transactions flow in automatically. Balances stay current. You spend time on actual bookkeeping instead of data entry.

## Connecting via Plaid

Most bank connections use Plaid, a secure service trusted by thousands of financial apps (Venmo, Robinhood, and most fintech apps you've used).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Banking">
    Navigate to **Settings → Banking** or **Banking → Accounts**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Connect Bank">
    Click **Connect Bank Account** to open the Plaid interface.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find your bank">
    Search for your bank by name. Over 12,000 institutions are supported — if you've heard of it, it's probably there.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log in">
    Enter your online banking credentials. This happens in Plaid's secure interface — we never see your password.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select accounts">
    Choose which accounts to connect (checking, savings, credit cards).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Done">
    Transactions start importing immediately. Historical data (up to 24 months) imports within a few hours.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What we can and can't access

When you connect a bank account, we receive:

| Data | What we use it for |
|------|-------------------|
| Account balances | Cash position, dashboard metrics |
| Transaction history | Categorization, reporting, reconciliation |
| Account info | Name, type, last 4 digits |

We **don't** receive:
- Your login credentials (ever)
- Full account numbers
- Ability to move money

<Info>
All bank connections are read-only. We cannot initiate transfers, payments, or any changes to your accounts. Technically impossible.
</Info>

## Direct integrations

Some banks offer direct integrations with enhanced features:

| Bank | What you get |
|------|----------|
| Mercury | Real-time sync, full history, enhanced transaction details |
| More coming | We're adding more direct integrations |

For banks with direct integrations, connect through **Settings → Integrations** instead of Plaid. You'll get better data.

## What account types work

| Account type | Supported |
|--------------|-----------|
| Checking | ✓ |
| Savings | ✓ |
| Money market | ✓ |
| Credit cards | ✓ |
| Lines of credit | ✓ |
| Business loans | Varies by bank |

## Connecting multiple accounts

Connect as many accounts as you need:

- Multiple accounts at the same bank
- Accounts at different banks
- Credit cards
- Both business and personal (if you need to track both)

Each account appears separately. You can manage them independently, and we won't mix your transactions.

## How often transactions sync

| Sync type | When it happens |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Automatic | Every 6-12 hours |
| Manual | Click "Sync Now" anytime |
| Initial | First sync imports up to 24 months |

New transactions typically appear within a few hours of posting to your bank. Not instant, but close enough for most bookkeeping.

## Connection health

Monitor connection status in **Banking → Accounts**:

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------|
| 🟢 Connected | Working normally |
| 🟡 Needs attention | Temporary issue, usually resolves on its own |
| 🔴 Disconnected | Your bank needs you to re-authenticate |

## When connections break

Connections occasionally need refreshing — usually because you changed your bank password, or your bank pushed a security update.

When that happens:

1. Go to **Banking → Accounts**
2. Click on the affected account
3. Click **Reconnect**
4. Log in again through Plaid

Takes about 30 seconds. Your historical data stays intact.

## Security

Bank connections are secured by:

- **Plaid's security** — SOC 2 Type II certified, bank-level encryption
- **No credential storage** — We never see or store your password
- **Token-based access** — Secure tokens, not credentials
- **Read-only access** — Cannot modify your accounts

Your bank data is probably safer in Plaid than in most other systems you use.
