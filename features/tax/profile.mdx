Before Pluvel can file taxes on your behalf, we need to know who you are — your EIN, your state tax accounts, your entity type. This is the boring-but-essential setup that makes everything else work.

Set it up once. We use it for every payroll tax deposit, every quarterly filing, every W-2 and 1099 at year-end.

## What's in your tax profile

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Federal EIN** | Your 9-digit Employer Identification Number (XX-XXXXXXX) |
| **State Tax ID** | State withholding/unemployment account numbers |
| **Business Type** | Sole Prop, LLC, S-Corp, C-Corp, Partnership, Nonprofit |
| **Tax Year** | Calendar (Jan-Dec) or Fiscal |
| **Accounting Method** | Cash or Accrual |

## Setting up your tax profile

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings → Tax">
    From your dashboard, click **Settings** in the sidebar, then **Tax**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your Federal EIN">
    Your EIN is the 9-digit number the IRS assigned when you registered as an employer. Format: XX-XXXXXXX.

    <Info>
    Don't have an EIN? If you formed your company through Pluvel, we applied for one automatically. Check **Company → Documents** for your EIN confirmation letter.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add state tax accounts">
    For each state where you have employees or tax obligations, enter:

    - **State Withholding Account** — For income tax withheld from employee paychecks
    - **State Unemployment Account** — Your SUTA/SUI account number
    - **Tax Rates** — Your assigned unemployment rate (if known)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm business details">
    Verify your:
    - Legal business name (must match IRS records exactly)
    - Business address
    - Entity type
    - Fiscal year end
  </Step>
</Steps>

## State tax registrations

When you hire employees in a new state, you need to register for state taxes. Pluvel can help with this.

### States with automatic registration

For these states, we can register you automatically when you add your first employee:

- California
- Texas
- Florida
- New York
- And 20+ others

When you add an employee in a new state, we'll prompt you to authorize registration.

### Manual registration states

Some states require you to register directly:

1. We provide the registration links and instructions
2. You complete registration on the state's website
3. Enter your account numbers in Pluvel

## Tax calendar integration

Your tax profile powers your tax calendar. Once set up, you'll see:

- **Filing deadlines** — Federal and state due dates
- **Payment reminders** — When deposits are due
- **Form availability** — When W-2s, 1099s, and other forms are ready

Go to **Dashboard → Compliance** to see your upcoming tax obligations.

## Changing your tax profile

### Updating tax IDs

You can update state tax account numbers anytime. Federal EIN changes are rare (usually only after a business restructure) and require verification.

### Changing entity type

If your business changes from LLC to S-Corp (or similar):

1. Update your entity type in Settings → Tax
2. We adjust withholding calculations going forward
3. Historical data remains under the original entity type

<Warning>
Entity type changes have significant tax implications. Consult a tax professional before making this change.
</Warning>

### Multi-state expansion

When you expand to a new state:

1. Go to **Settings → Tax → State Tax Accounts**
2. Click **Add State**
3. Select the state and enter account numbers (or request registration)

## Verification and accuracy

### Why accuracy matters

Incorrect tax profile information can cause:

- Failed payroll tax deposits
- IRS and state notices
- Penalty assessments
- W-2/1099 mismatches

### Verification process

When you enter or change tax identifiers, we verify them against:

- IRS EIN database (for federal)
- State agency records (where available)

If verification fails, you'll see a warning. Double-check your numbers before proceeding.
