---

FUTA — Federal Unemployment Tax — is the one payroll tax that comes entirely out of your pocket, not your employees'. It funds federal unemployment programs and is filed once a year on Form 940.

The math is straightforward: you pay 0.6% on the first $7,000 each employee earns (assuming you paid your state unemployment taxes on time). That's about $42 per employee per year. Pluvel handles the deposits and filing automatically.

## What FUTA is

FUTA funds unemployment insurance at the federal level. It works alongside state unemployment (SUTA):

| Aspect | FUTA | SUTA |
|--------|------|------|
| Who pays | Employer only | Employer (usually) |
| Rate | 6.0% (0.6% after credit) | Varies by state and employer |
| Wage base | First $7,000 per employee | Varies by state |
| Filed on | Form 940 | State forms |

### The FUTA credit

If you pay state unemployment taxes on time, you receive a credit against FUTA:

- **Standard credit:** 5.4%
- **Net FUTA rate:** 6.0% - 5.4% = 0.6%

This means you effectively pay 0.6% on the first $7,000 per employee = **$42 per employee per year** maximum.

<Info>
Some states have credit reduction due to federal unemployment loans. This increases your FUTA rate slightly. We track this and apply the correct rate.

## Filing schedule

Form 940 is filed annually:

| For Tax Year | Due Date |
|--------------|----------|
| 2025 | January 31, 2026 |
| 2026 | January 31, 2027 |

If you deposited all FUTA tax when due, you have until February 10 to file.

## FUTA deposits

FUTA deposits are made quarterly (not with each payroll):

| Quarter | Period | Deposit Due |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Q1 | January - March | April 30 |
| Q2 | April - June | July 31 |
| Q3 | July - September | October 31 |
| Q4 | October - December | January 31 |

<Info>
You only need to deposit if your accumulated FUTA liability exceeds $500. If it's $500 or less, you can carry it to the next quarter.
</Info>

### How deposits work

1. After each payroll, we calculate FUTA on wages up to $7,000 per employee
2. We accumulate the liability through the quarter
3. If it exceeds $500, we deposit on time
4. If under $500, it carries forward (deposited with the 940 or next quarter)

## Credit reduction states

When states borrow from the federal government to pay unemployment benefits and don't repay on time, employers in that state lose part of their FUTA credit:

### How it works

- Normal credit: 5.4% (net rate 0.6%)
- If credit reduction applies: Credit reduced by 0.3% per year
- You pay higher FUTA tax

### Checking your state

We monitor credit reduction states and apply the correct rate automatically. Affected states are listed on Form 940 Schedule A.

Recent credit reduction states have included:

- California (historically)
- New York (historically)
- Various states during economic downturns

## Common 940 situations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multi-state employers">
    If you have employees in multiple states:

    1. FUTA applies to all employees regardless of state
    2. State unemployment credits vary by state
    3. We calculate blended credits based on wages in each state
    4. Schedule A lists your state breakdown
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="New employer">
    If this is your first year:

    1. You may not have paid enough SUTA to get full credit
    2. Your 940 may show additional FUTA due
    3. This balances out as your state payments normalize
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Employees over wage base">
    Once an employee earns $7,000:

    1. No more FUTA accrues for them that year
    2. Most employees hit this in Q1 or Q2
    3. Your quarterly deposits decrease as more employees max out
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Overpayment on Line 15">
    If you deposited more than you owe:

    1. You can apply the overpayment to next year's 940
    2. Or request a refund from the IRS
    3. We note the overpayment and track the credit
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Special considerations

### Exempt wages

Certain payments don't count toward FUTA:

- Family employees (under certain conditions)
- Wages to H-2A visa workers
- Retirement/pension payments
- Group life insurance payments

We exclude exempt wages automatically based on your payroll setup.

### Closing a business

If you close your business during the year:

1. File a final 940 covering the period you were open
2. Check the "final return" box
3. We help you with the closure process
