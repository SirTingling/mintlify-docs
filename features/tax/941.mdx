description: Quarterly federal payroll tax return filed by Pluvel.
---

Every quarter, the IRS wants to know: how much did you pay employees, how much did you withhold for taxes, and did you deposit that money on time? That's Form 941 — the quarterly report that reconciles your payroll with your tax deposits.

Pluvel prepares and files your 941 automatically. You'll see a draft before we submit, but you shouldn't need to touch it.

## What Form 941 reports

| Section | What's Reported |
|---------|-----------------|
| Part 1 | Total wages, tips, and other compensation |
| Part 2 | Federal income tax withheld |
| Part 3 | Social Security wages and tax |
| Part 4 | Medicare wages and tax |
| Part 5 | Adjustments and prior quarter corrections |
| Part 6 | Total tax liability and deposits made |

## Filing schedule

Form 941 is due quarterly:

| Quarter | Period | Due Date |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Q1 | January - March | April 30 |
| Q2 | April - June | July 31 |
| Q3 | July - September | October 31 |
| Q4 | October - December | January 31 |

<Info>
If a due date falls on a weekend or holiday, the deadline moves to the next business day.

    About 5 days before the deadline, we generate your 941 with all figures.
  </Step>

  <Step title="You review (optional)">
    Go to **Payroll → Tax Filings** to review before we submit. You'll see a draft 941.
  </Step>

  <Step title="We file electronically">
    We file with the IRS before the deadline and provide confirmation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing your 941

Go to **Payroll → Tax Filings → 941** to see:

- **Draft 941** — For the current quarter (before filing)
- **Filed 941s** — Historical returns with confirmation numbers
- **Amended 941s** — If corrections were needed

### Key figures on the form

| Line | Description | Your Data |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Line 2 | Wages, tips, other compensation | Total gross wages |
| Line 3 | Federal income tax withheld | Total withholding |
| Line 5a | Taxable Social Security wages | Usually equals Line 2 |
| Line 5c | Taxable Medicare wages | Usually equals Line 2 |
| Line 12 | Total taxes after adjustments | Sum of all taxes |
| Line 13 | Total deposits for quarter | Should match Line 12 |

<Info>
If Line 12 and Line 13 match, you've made correct deposits. A difference means you owe or overpaid.

## Common 941 situations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Correction needed (941-X)">
    If you discover an error after filing:

    1. We prepare Form 941-X (amended return)
    2. Explain the correction and reason
    3. File with the IRS
    4. Pay any additional tax or claim a refund

    Common reasons for amendments:
    - Retroactive pay adjustments
    - Employee classification corrections
    - Wrong withholding rates applied
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No wages paid this quarter">
    If you didn't run payroll in a quarter:

    1. We still file a 941 with zeros
    2. This maintains your filing status
    3. Alternatively, we can file final 941 if you're closing

    Never skip filing—the IRS expects a return every quarter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Balance due on Line 14">
    If your deposits don't cover your liability:

    1. The difference appears on Line 14
    2. We include payment with the return (debited from your funding account)
    3. Late payments may incur penalties

    This usually happens if a payroll was processed late in the quarter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Third-party sick pay">
    If a third party (insurance company) paid sick pay:

    1. Report it on Schedule B if applicable
    2. Coordinate with your provider on who reports which taxes
    3. We can help you set this up correctly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Schedule B

If you're a semi-weekly depositor, you must also file Schedule B with your 941:

- Shows tax liability for each day of the quarter
- We generate this automatically based on your payroll dates
- Attached to Form 941

## Penalties for late filing or payment

| Violation | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| Late filing (up to 5 days) | 2% of unpaid tax |
| 6-15 days late | 5% of unpaid tax |
| More than 15 days late | 10% of unpaid tax |
| 10+ days after first notice | 15% of unpaid tax |
| Late payment | Varies based on time and amount |

<Warning>
Penalties can add up quickly. If you're having cash flow issues, contact us before missing a deposit—we may be able to help you work with the IRS.
</Warning>

## Trust fund recovery penalty

A special risk: if payroll taxes go unpaid, the IRS can hold business owners personally liable for the "trust fund" portion (employee withholding). This applies even if the business closes.

Pluvel prevents this by:

- Collecting taxes with each payroll
- Making timely deposits
- Alerting you to any issues immediately
