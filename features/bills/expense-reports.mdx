description: Let employees submit expenses for reimbursement.
---

Your employees buy things for the business — client dinners, travel, supplies. Expense reports give them a way to submit those purchases for reimbursement without you chasing receipts.

## How It Works

1. Employee spends their own money on something for work
2. They submit an expense report with receipts
3. You (or a manager) approve it
4. They get reimbursed

Simple. The complexity is in the details: categories, policies, approvals, receipt requirements.

## Employee View

Employees access expense reports through their Pluvel account (or the mobile app).

**Submit an expense:**
- Enter the amount, date, vendor, and category
- Upload a photo of the receipt
- Add notes if needed
- Submit for approval

**View status:**
- Pending (waiting for approval)
- Approved (waiting for payment)
- Reimbursed (done)
- Rejected (with reason)

Employees don't need full Pluvel access. You can invite them as "expense only" users who can only submit and view their own expenses.

## Submitting Expenses

Employees can submit expenses:

**One at a time** — Bought lunch with a client? Submit it immediately from your phone.

**As a batch** — Traveling for a week? Save expenses, then submit them all as one report when you're back.

**From email** — Forward receipts to expenses@yourcompany.pluvel.com. We'll create draft expenses from them.

<Info>
The mobile app is the easiest way to submit expenses. Snap a photo of the receipt, add details, submit. Takes 30 seconds.

## Expense Policies

Set rules for what's allowed:

| Policy | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Spending limits | Meals up to $50, flights up to $500 |
| Required receipts | Receipts required over $25 |
| Categories allowed | Only Travel, Meals, and Supplies |
| Pre-approval required | Amounts over $200 need pre-approval |

Go to **Settings → Expenses → Policies** to configure.

Expenses that violate policy get flagged. You can still approve them, but you'll see the warning.

## Approval Workflows

Configure who approves what:

**Default approver** — One person approves all expenses (common for small teams)

**Manager approval** — Expenses go to the submitter's manager

**Threshold-based** — Under $100 auto-approves, over $100 needs manual approval

**Multi-level** — Under $500 goes to manager, over $500 needs owner approval too

Set this up in **Settings → Expenses → Approvals**.

## Approving Expenses

As an approver, you'll see pending expenses in your dashboard and get email notifications.

For each expense:
- View the receipt
- Check the amount and category
- See any policy violations
- Approve or reject (with a reason)

Approve multiple expenses at once if they all look fine. Or review each individually if you want.

## Reimbursement

Approved expenses need to be paid. Options:

**Add to payroll** — Reimbursements go out with the next paycheck. Tax-free, but only works on pay dates.

**Direct reimbursement** — Pay immediately via bank transfer. Separate from payroll.

**Manual** — You write a check or Venmo them. Just mark it as reimbursed in Pluvel.

Configure your default reimbursement method in **Settings → Expenses → Reimbursement**.

## Categories

Standard expense categories:
- Travel (flights, hotels, car rental)
- Meals & Entertainment
- Office Supplies
- Software & Subscriptions
- Professional Development
- Client Expenses (reimbursable to client)
- Other

Add custom categories in **Settings → Expenses → Categories**. Categories map to your chart of accounts for proper expense tracking.

## Mileage Tracking

For employees using their personal vehicles:

1. Create an expense with category "Mileage"
2. Enter miles driven
3. Pluvel calculates reimbursement at the IRS rate ($0.67/mile for 2024)

You can set a custom rate if your company pays differently.

## Receipt Requirements

Receipts matter for:
- Tax deductions (you need documentation)
- Audit trails (proving the expense was legitimate)
- Fraud prevention (employees can't just make up expenses)

Pluvel stores receipts attached to expenses. They're searchable and backed up.

<Warning>
Missing receipts for expenses over $75 are generally not deductible. Enforce receipt requirements to protect your tax deductions.
</Warning>

## Reporting

**Expense Summary** — Total expenses by category, employee, or time period.

**Policy Violations** — How often expenses exceed limits or miss receipts.

**Reimbursement Aging** — Approved expenses waiting for payment.

Find these in **Reports → Expenses**.

## Tips for Employees

- Submit promptly. Don't hoard receipts for months.
- Take clear photos. Blurry receipts get rejected.
- Include business purpose. "Client lunch" not just "Chipotle."
- Check your category. Miscategorized expenses delay approval.

## Tips for Approvers

- Set up policies and let them do the work. You shouldn't manually check if lunch was under $50.
- Approve in batches. Once a week is usually fine unless it's time-sensitive.
- Communicate rejections. "Rejected - missing receipt" helps employees fix it.
