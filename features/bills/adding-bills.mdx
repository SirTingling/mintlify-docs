description: Track bills and what you owe vendors.

Your vendor sent an invoice. If you don't track it somewhere, it either gets paid twice or not at all — both bad.

Bills in Pluvel are the opposite of invoices: instead of money coming in, it's money going out. Record them here so you know what you owe, when it's due, and where your expenses are actually going.

## Adding a bill

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Bills">
    Navigate to **Bills & Expenses → Bills** or click **Add Bill**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select vendor">
    Choose an existing vendor or create a new one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter bill details">
    - Bill number (from the vendor's invoice)
    - Bill date
    - Due date
    - Total amount
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add line items">
    Break down what you purchased:
    - Description
    - Category/account
    - Amount
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Bill is recorded and shows up in your payables.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bill fields

| Field | What it's for |
|-------|-------------|
| Vendor | Who you owe |
| Bill number | The vendor's invoice number (for matching later) |
| Bill date | Date on vendor's invoice |
| Due date | When you need to pay |
| Reference | Your internal reference or PO number |
| Line items | What you bought |
| Notes | Internal notes (vendor won't see these) |

## Uploading bill images

Attach the original bill so you have it when you need it:

1. Click **Attach** or drag-and-drop
2. Upload PDF or image
3. Bill is stored with the record

No more digging through email to find that invoice from February.

### OCR scanning

For uploaded bills, we can extract:
- Vendor name
- Amount
- Date
- Bill number

Review what we extracted and confirm. Not perfect, but saves typing.

## Email bills directly to Pluvel

Forward vendor invoices without even opening Pluvel:

1. Find your unique bills email in Settings
2. Forward vendor invoices to that address
3. Bills appear in your inbox for review

Your AP@ email can auto-forward everything here.

## Bill status

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------|
| Draft | Started but not finalized |
| Open | Recorded, ready for payment |
| Partial | You paid some, not all |
| Paid | Fully paid |
| Overdue | Past due date, still unpaid |
| Void | Cancelled |

## Categorizing line items

For each thing you bought, assign the right expense account:

- Office Supplies
- Rent
- Utilities
- Professional Services
- Software Subscriptions
- Equipment
- etc.

This is what makes your expense reports accurate. "Where did all our money go?" becomes answerable.

## Splitting bills

One bill, multiple categories? Common situation:

1. Add multiple line items
2. Assign each to the right account
3. Total matches the bill amount

Example: A $500 Amazon order — $300 to office supplies, $200 to equipment.

## Bill approval workflow

For teams where not everyone should be able to commit to payments:

1. Go to **Settings → Bills → Approvals**
2. Enable approval workflow
3. Set approval thresholds (auto-approve under $100, require approval over)
4. Bills route for approval before they can be paid

## Duplicate detection

We'll warn you if you enter a bill that looks like a duplicate:

- Same vendor
- Same amount
- Same (or similar) date

Better to catch it before you pay something twice.

## Bill reminders

Get notified before bills are due:

1. Go to **Settings → Notifications**
2. Enable bill reminders
3. Set how many days before due date
4. Receive email or dashboard notification

Never miss a due date. Never pay late fees you didn't have to.
