The bill is recorded. Now you need to actually pay it — and track that you did.

Recording payments keeps your books accurate. You'll know what's still owed versus what's been paid, and your accounts payable won't show phantom balances from bills you settled months ago.

## Recording a payment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the bill">
    Find the bill you're paying.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Pay Bill">
    Click **Record Payment** or **Pay Bill**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter payment details">
    - Payment date
    - Amount paid
    - Payment method (check, ACH, card, etc.)
    - Which account you paid from
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Bill status updates to paid (or partial if it's not the full amount).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Paying multiple bills at once

Running a batch of payments?

1. Go to **Bills → Pay Bills**
2. Select the bills you're paying
3. Click **Pay Selected**
4. Enter payment details
5. Record as a batch payment

Faster than doing them one by one.

## Payment methods

| Method | What to record |
|--------|---------------|
| Check | Check number |
| ACH/Wire | Transfer reference |
| Credit card | Will auto-import from card feed |
| Cash | Record as cash payment |
| Vendor credit | Apply available credit first |

## Matching bank transactions

When you pay a bill and that payment shows up in your bank feed:

1. Open the bank transaction
2. Click **Match to Bill**
3. Select which bill(s) it pays
4. Confirm

The transaction gets categorized correctly, and the bill gets marked paid. Two birds.

## Partial payments

Sometimes you don't pay the whole thing:

1. Record payment with the partial amount
2. Bill status changes to "Partial"
3. Remaining balance tracked
4. Pay the rest when you can

The bill stays visible until it's fully paid.

## Vendor credits

If a vendor gave you a credit (refund, return, overcharge):

1. Go to vendor profile
2. Add the credit amount
3. When paying future bills, apply credit first
4. Pay remaining balance

Credits reduce what you actually owe.

## Scheduled payments

Plan payments in advance:

1. Open the bill
2. Click **Schedule Payment**
3. Set the payment date
4. You'll get a reminder when that date arrives

<Info>
Pluvel doesn't initiate actual payments — we record them and remind you. Use your bank to actually move the money.
</Info>

## Payment history

See every payment made on a bill:

1. Open the bill
2. Look at the **Payments** section
3. See each payment with date, amount, and method

Useful when someone asks "did we ever pay that?"

## Voiding payments

Recorded a payment by mistake?

1. Open the bill
2. Find the payment
3. Click **Void**
4. Bill reopens for the voided amount

The audit trail shows what happened — the payment was voided, not deleted.

## Check runs

For businesses that still write checks:

1. Go to **Bills → Pay Bills**
2. Select bills to pay by check
3. Click **Print Checks**
4. Print on your check stock
5. Payments recorded automatically

Requires check printing setup in Settings.

## Payment reports

Track what you've paid:

- **AP Aging** — What you owe and when it's due
- **Payment History** — All payments made to vendors
- **Cash Requirements** — Upcoming payments you'll need to make
