Every bill comes from someone. Instead of retyping "Acme Supplies, 123 Main Street, Net 30" every time, save your vendors once and reuse their info forever.

Vendor records also track payment history, W-9 status (important for 1099s), and how much you've spent with them over time.

## Adding a vendor

  <Step title="Save">
