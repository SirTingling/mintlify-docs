description: Create POs to authorize purchases before you receive a bill.
---

Purchase orders let you formally request goods or services from a vendor before they send you a bill. It's a commitment to buy — and a way to control what gets purchased and by whom.

Not every business needs POs. But if you have multiple people making purchases, or you want a paper trail before money goes out the door, they're useful.

## When to Use Purchase Orders

**Multi-person approval** — Someone requests, someone else approves
**Vendor expectations** — Some vendors require a PO number before they'll ship
**Budget control** — See committed spend before bills arrive
**Matching** — Compare what you ordered to what you were billed

If you're a solo founder buying stuff as needed, you probably don't need this. If you have a team placing orders, you might.

## Creating a Purchase Order

Go to **Finance → Bills → Purchase Orders** and click **New PO**.

Fill in:
- **Vendor** — Who you're ordering from
- **Line items** — What you're buying, quantities, prices
- **Delivery date** (optional) — When you expect it
- **Shipping address** (optional) — Where to send it
- **Notes** — Special instructions for the vendor

Pluvel assigns a PO number automatically. You can customize the format in Settings.

## Sending to Vendors

Once created, you can:

**Email the PO** — Send directly from Pluvel. Vendor gets a PDF they can reference.

**Download PDF** — Send it yourself through your own email.

**Mark as sent** — If you called it in or ordered through their portal, just mark it sent for your records.

The vendor fulfills the order and eventually sends you a bill.

## PO Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Draft | Not sent yet |
| Sent | Waiting for vendor to fulfill |
| Partial | Some items received, not all |
| Received | Everything delivered |
| Billed | Bill received and matched |
| Closed | Complete, nothing more to do |
| Cancelled | Order cancelled before fulfillment |

Most POs go: Draft → Sent → Received → Billed → Closed.

## Receiving Against a PO

When stuff arrives:

1. Go to the PO
2. Click **Receive**
3. Mark which items arrived (and quantities)
4. Save

If everything arrived, the PO moves to "Received." If only some arrived, it's "Partial" and you can receive the rest later.

## Matching Bills to POs

When the vendor's bill arrives:

1. Create the bill (or it syncs from email)
2. Click **Match to PO**
3. Select the PO
4. Pluvel compares line items

**3-way matching** — PO, received items, and bill all line up. This is the gold standard. You ordered 10 widgets, received 10 widgets, and were billed for 10 widgets.

If something doesn't match:
- Billed for more than you ordered? Flag it.
- Received less than billed? Don't pay the full amount.
- Prices different? Investigate before paying.

<Info>
3-way matching catches errors and fraud. Vendor bills you for items you never received? The match fails and you investigate before paying.

## Approval Workflows

If you want purchases approved before they go out:

1. Go to **Settings → Bills → Approvals**
2. Enable PO approvals
3. Set thresholds (approve all POs, or only those over $500, etc.)
4. Assign approvers

When someone creates a PO, it goes into "Pending Approval" status. Approver gets notified, reviews, and approves or rejects.

## Committed Spend

POs represent money you've committed but not yet billed for. This is useful for budgeting.

**Reports → Committed Spend** shows:
- Open PO value (what you've promised to pay)
- Received but not billed (delivered, waiting for invoice)
- Cash flow projection including committed purchases

So if you have $50,000 in the bank and $20,000 in open POs, your actual available cash might be closer to $30,000.

## When POs Are Overkill

You probably don't need POs for:
- Recurring subscriptions (Slack, AWS, etc.)
- Small, frequent purchases under a threshold
- Expenses you reimburse employees for

Use POs where the formality adds value — larger purchases, vendor relationships with history, situations where you need approval controls.

## Tips

**Set a threshold.** Not everything needs a PO. Maybe only purchases over $500. Configure what makes sense for your business.

**Don't skip receiving.** The PO → Receive → Bill workflow breaks down if you skip receiving. You lose the ability to catch billing errors.

**Close stale POs.** Old POs that will never be fulfilled should be cancelled. They clutter your reports and overstate committed spend.
