Rent is due on the first. The software subscription charges on the 15th. Insurance premium hits quarterly.

You could enter these bills manually every time. Or you could set them up once and let them generate automatically, so you never forget that the rent is due and scramble to record it after the fact.

## Creating a recurring bill

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter the bill">
    Create the bill as normal — vendor, amount, line items.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make it recurring">
    Click **Make Recurring** instead of Save.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the schedule">
    - How often (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually)
    - Start date
    - End date (optional)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Bills generate automatically on schedule.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Schedule options

| Frequency | Good for |
|-----------|-------------|
| Weekly | Weekly service payments |
| Bi-weekly | Every two weeks |
| Monthly | Rent, subscriptions, most recurring expenses |
| Quarterly | Insurance premiums, quarterly services |
| Annually | Annual renewals, yearly fees |
| Custom | Specific intervals (every 45 days, etc.) |

## How it works

When the scheduled date arrives:

1. Bill is created automatically
2. Status: Open (ready for payment)
3. You get a notification
4. Review and pay as normal

You don't have to remember — it just shows up.

### Draft mode

If you want to review before the bill goes live:

1. Enable **Create as Draft**
2. Bills generate as drafts
3. Review and approve each one
4. Then mark as open

Good for bills where the amount might vary slightly.

## Managing recurring bills

View all your recurring schedules:

1. Go to **Bills → Recurring**
2. See all active schedules
3. Click any to edit or manage

### Pause

Stop temporarily (vacation, project on hold):

1. Click the recurring bill
2. Click **Pause**
3. No new bills generate until you resume

### Edit

Change the template:

1. Click **Edit**
2. Modify amount, vendor, line items
3. Changes apply to future bills only

Already-generated bills stay as they were.

### Cancel

Stop permanently:

1. Click **Cancel**
2. No future bills generate
3. History preserved

## Common recurring bills

| Bill type | Typical frequency |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Rent/lease | Monthly |
| Software subscriptions | Monthly |
| Insurance | Monthly or quarterly |
| Utilities | Monthly |
| Phone/internet | Monthly |
| Professional services | Monthly |
| Loan payments | Monthly |

## Variable amounts

For bills that aren't exactly the same every time (like utilities):

1. Enable **Variable Amount**
2. Each cycle, update the amount before it generates
3. Or let it generate and edit before paying

## Price increases

When a vendor raises their prices:

1. Edit the recurring bill
2. Update the amount
3. Save

Future bills use the new amount. Previous bills aren't affected.

## Setting an end date

For contracts or subscriptions that end:

1. Edit the recurring bill
2. Set **End Date**
3. Last bill generates on or before that date

Or set **Number of Occurrences** ("generate 12 bills, then stop").
