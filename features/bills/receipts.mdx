That shoe box full of receipts? The pile on your desk? The photos in your camera roll from six months ago?

There's a better way. Capture receipts as you get them, match them to transactions, and have everything organized when tax season arrives or when your accountant asks for backup.

## Capturing receipts

### Mobile upload (fastest)

1. Open Pluvel on your phone
2. Tap **Add Receipt**
3. Take a photo
4. Receipt uploads and processes

Do it while you're still at the register. Future you will thank present you.

### Email forwarding

Forward receipts straight to Pluvel:

1. Find your unique receipts email in Settings
2. Forward receipts to that address
3. Receipts appear in your inbox

Good for emailed receipts — just forward and done.

### Drag and drop

On desktop:

1. Go to **Receipts**
2. Drag and drop images or PDFs
3. Uploaded and processed

## OCR processing

We extract information automatically:

| Field | What we find |
|-------|-----------|
| Vendor | Store/merchant name |
| Date | Purchase date |
| Amount | Total amount |
| Items | Line items (when they're clear) |

Review what we extracted and confirm. Saves typing, though you should double-check.

## Receipt inbox

Receipts you haven't matched to anything yet:

1. Go to **Receipts → Inbox**
2. See all receipts waiting
3. Match to transactions or create expenses

Don't let receipts pile up here. Weekly cleanup keeps things manageable.

## Matching receipts to transactions

### Manual matching

1. Open the receipt
2. Click **Match to Transaction**
3. Find the corresponding bank transaction
4. Confirm match

Receipt attaches to the transaction. Done.

### Auto-matching

We suggest matches based on:
- Amount
- Date
- Vendor name

Review suggestions and confirm. Usually pretty accurate for clear receipts.

## Creating expenses from receipts

If there's no bank transaction (you paid cash, or it hasn't imported yet):

1. Open the receipt
2. Click **Create Expense**
3. Details pre-filled from what we extracted
4. Complete and save

## Organizing receipts

### Tags

Add tags to receipts for easy filtering:
- Client name
- Project
- Trip (SXSW 2025, Client visit, etc.)
- Category

### Folders

Organize into folders:
- By month
- By project
- By employee

Find anything in seconds instead of scrolling through hundreds of receipts.

## What makes a valid receipt

| Element | Why you need it |
|---------|--------------|
| Vendor name | Proves where you spent money |
| Date | Proves when |
| Amount | Proves how much |
| Items | Shows what you bought (important for audits) |
| Payment method | Sometimes required by policy |

<Warning>
Credit card statements alone aren't sufficient for audit purposes. The IRS wants itemized receipts showing what you actually purchased.
</Warning>

## Finding missing receipts

Track transactions that need receipts:

1. Go to **Receipts → Missing**
2. See transactions flagged for missing receipts
3. Upload receipts or mark as "Receipt unavailable"

### Receipt affidavit

For lost receipts over your threshold:

1. Describe the expense
2. Explain why the receipt is missing
3. Sign the affidavit
4. Attach to the transaction

Not ideal, but better than nothing for legitimate expenses.

## How long to keep receipts

| Type | Keep for |
|------|-----------|
| Regular expenses | 7 years |
| Asset purchases | Life of asset + 7 years |
| Tax-related | 7 years minimum |

We store them securely with backups. No shoe boxes required.

## Exporting receipts

Export for:
- External auditors
- Tax preparation
- Your own backup

Options:
- PDF bundle (all receipts in one file)
- Individual images
- With transaction data (CSV)

## Settings

Configure how receipts work:

| Setting | What it controls |
|---------|---------|
| Receipt required over | Dollar threshold for required receipts |
| OCR processing | On/off |
| Auto-match | Enabled/disabled |
| Email address | Your unique receipts email |
