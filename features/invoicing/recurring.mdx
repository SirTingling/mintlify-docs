You bill the same client the same amount every month. Or every week. Or every quarter.

Creating that invoice manually each time is tedious. Forgetting to send it is expensive.

Recurring invoices solve both problems. Set it up once, and invoices generate and send automatically on schedule. You get paid without thinking about it.

## Creating a recurring invoice

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the invoice">
    Build your invoice as normal — customer, line items, amounts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make it recurring">
    Instead of clicking Send, click **Make Recurring**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the schedule">
    How often?
    - Weekly
    - Bi-weekly
    - Monthly
    - Quarterly
    - Annually
    - Custom interval
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the timing">
    - **Start date:** When the first invoice generates
    - **End date:** When to stop (leave blank for indefinite)
    - **Send day:** Which day of the period to send
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Invoices now generate automatically on schedule.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Schedule options

| Frequency | Best for |
|-----------|----------|
| Weekly | Ongoing weekly services, hourly billing |
| Bi-weekly | Every two weeks |
| Monthly | Retainers, subscriptions, SaaS |
| Quarterly | Quarterly services, consulting |
| Annually | Annual renewals, maintenance contracts |
| Custom | Any specific interval (every 45 days, etc.) |

## Timing details

### Start date

When should the first invoice go out? Can be today or a future date.

### End date

When should invoices stop? Leave blank if it's ongoing (like a retainer with no end date).

### Number of occurrences

Alternative to end date — "send 12 invoices then stop."

### Send day

- For monthly: which day (1-28, or "last day of month")
- For weekly: which day of the week

## Auto-send vs. draft mode

| Mode | What happens |
|------|----------|
| Auto-send | Invoice generates and emails automatically |
| Draft | Invoice generates but waits for your review |

Use draft mode if amounts might vary or you need to add details before sending. Auto-send if it's truly the same every time.

## Managing recurring invoices

View all your recurring schedules:

1. Go to **Invoicing → Recurring**
2. See all active and paused schedules
3. Click any to view details

### Pause

Stop temporarily without deleting:

1. Click the recurring invoice
2. Click **Pause**
3. No new invoices generate until you resume

Useful for clients on vacation or projects on hold.

### Resume

Click **Resume** to restart a paused schedule. Next invoice generates on the normal schedule.

### Edit

Change the amount, line items, or schedule:

1. Click the recurring invoice
2. Click **Edit**
3. Make changes
4. Save

Changes apply to future invoices. Already-generated invoices stay as they were.

### Cancel

Stop permanently:

1. Click the recurring invoice
2. Click **Cancel**
3. No future invoices generate

Previous invoices remain in your records.

## Generated invoices

Each recurring schedule creates individual invoices:

- Linked back to the recurring schedule
- Can be edited individually if needed
- Track payments separately

View all generated invoices from the recurring invoice detail page.

## Dynamic content

Use variables for content that changes:

| Variable | What it becomes |
|----------|--------|
| `{{period_start}}` | Start date of billing period |
| `{{period_end}}` | End date of billing period |
| `{{month}}` | Current month name |
| `{{year}}` | Current year |

Example line item: "Monthly retainer - {{month}} {{year}}"

Becomes: "Monthly retainer - February 2025"

## Changing prices

Need to raise your rates?

1. Edit the recurring invoice
2. Update the line item amounts
3. Save

The next invoice uses the new price. Previous invoices keep the old price.

## Notifying customers

Configure what customers receive:

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| Invoice email | The invoice itself (customizable) |
| Upcoming notice | Heads-up before billing ("You'll be billed $X on March 1") |
| Payment receipt | Confirmation when payment received |

Upcoming notices are good for larger amounts or new recurring relationships.
