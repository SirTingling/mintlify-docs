The invoice is sent. Now you wait.

Or you could make it easier for customers to pay. Online payments mean they click a button instead of writing a check, finding an envelope, and remembering to mail it. You get paid faster. They don't have to think about it.

## Online payments

Let customers pay directly from their invoice with a credit card or bank transfer.

### Setting up

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Stripe">
    Go to **Settings → Payments → Connect Stripe** and complete the setup. Takes about 5 minutes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable on invoices">
    In invoice settings, enable **Allow Online Payments**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send invoices">
    Every invoice now includes a "Pay Now" button.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What customers can pay with

With Stripe connected:

- Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover)
- Debit cards
- ACH bank transfer (lower fees for you)
- Apple Pay / Google Pay

### The payment experience

When customers click "Pay Now":

1. They see the invoice details
2. Select payment method
3. Enter payment info (or use saved card)
4. Confirm payment
5. Receipt sent automatically

The whole thing takes about 30 seconds.

## Recording offline payments

For payments that come in outside Pluvel — checks, wire transfers, cash:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the invoice">
    Find it in your invoice list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Record Payment">
    Click **Record Payment**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter details">
    - Amount received
    - Date received
    - Payment method (check, cash, wire, etc.)
    - Reference number (check number, wire reference)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Invoice status updates automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Partial payments

Sometimes customers pay in installments. That's fine:

1. Record the partial amount
2. Invoice shows remaining balance
3. Customer can pay the rest later
4. Status shows "Partial" until paid in full

## Payment status

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------|
| Unpaid | Nothing received yet |
| Partial | Some payment, balance remaining |
| Paid | Full amount received |
| Overpaid | They paid more than owed (rare, but happens) |

## Processing fees

Online payments have fees (charged by Stripe, not us):

| Method | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| Credit/debit card | 2.9% + $0.30 |
| ACH bank transfer | 0.8% (max $5) |

On a $1,000 invoice, that's $29.30 for card or $5 for ACH. Fees are deducted from the payment — you receive the net amount.

### Passing fees to customers

Some businesses add a convenience fee for card payments:

1. Go to **Settings → Payments**
2. Enable **Add convenience fee**
3. Set percentage or fixed amount
4. Fee appears on invoice for card payments

Check your local regulations — some places restrict this.

## Payment receipts

When payment comes in, customers automatically receive:

- Confirmation of amount paid
- Invoice reference
- Payment method used
- PDF receipt attached

Customize the receipt email in **Settings → Emails → Payment Receipt**.

## Refunds

Sometimes you need to give money back:

1. Open the invoice
2. Click the payment
3. Click **Refund**
4. Enter refund amount (full or partial)
5. Confirm

For online payments, refund goes back to the original payment method. Usually takes 5-10 business days to appear.

## Automatic payment matching

When payments import from your bank:

1. Pluvel matches payments to invoices automatically
2. Uses amount and customer name to find matches
3. Suggests matches for your review
4. You confirm or adjust

Saves time when you're processing a lot of payments.

## Deposits and retainers

Collecting payment before work begins?

1. Create an invoice for the deposit amount
2. Send to customer
3. Record payment when received
4. Apply credit to the final invoice

Or use estimates with deposit requests (see [Estimates](/features/invoicing/estimates)).

## Payment links

Share a payment link directly — useful for texts, Slack, or any channel outside email:

1. Open the invoice
2. Click **Copy Payment Link**
3. Send however you want
4. Customer pays at the link

Same payment experience, different delivery method.
