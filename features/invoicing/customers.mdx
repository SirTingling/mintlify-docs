Every invoice needs a customer. Instead of typing their info each time, save it once and reuse it forever.

Customer records also give you history — every invoice you've sent them, every payment they've made, their current balance. Useful when someone asks "how much have we billed Acme Corp this year?"

## Adding a customer

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Customers">
    Navigate to **Invoicing → Customers** or click **Add Customer**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter their details">
    - Company name (or individual name)
    - Contact person
    - Email (where invoices go)
    - Phone
    - Billing address
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set defaults">
    - Payment terms (Net 30, etc.)
    - Tax status (taxable or exempt)
    - Currency (if different from your default)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Customer is ready for invoicing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customer information

| Field | What it's for |
|-------|---------|
| Company name | Primary identifier |
| Display name | How they appear on invoices |
| Contact name | Who to address communications to |
| Email | Where invoices get sent |
| Phone | Contact number |
| Billing address | Appears on invoices |
| Shipping address | If different from billing |

## Customer defaults

Set defaults that apply every time you invoice this customer:

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| Payment terms | Net 15, Net 30, Due on receipt, etc. |
| Tax status | Taxable or exempt |
| Tax exemption ID | For exempt customers (resellers, nonprofits) |
| Currency | Their preferred currency |
| Payment method | How they usually pay |

Saves you from setting these on every invoice.

All invoices and payments consolidate under one customer.

## Archiving customers

In the portal, they can:
