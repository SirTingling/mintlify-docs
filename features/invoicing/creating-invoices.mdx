You finished the work. Now you need to get paid.

The invoice is how that happens — a formal request for payment that tells your customer exactly what they owe and how to pay. A good invoice gets paid faster. A confusing one sits in someone's inbox for weeks.

## Creating an invoice

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Invoicing">
    Navigate to **Invoicing → Invoices** or click **New Invoice** from the dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select customer">
    Choose an existing customer or create a new one. Their billing info auto-fills.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add line items">
    Add what you're billing for:
    - Description
    - Quantity
    - Rate
    - Amount (calculated automatically)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review totals">
    Check subtotal, tax (if applicable), and total. Make sure it matches what you agreed on.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send or save">
    Send immediately or save as draft if you're not ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

No need to clutter your catalog with one-time items.
