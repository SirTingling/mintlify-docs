Pluvel can notify you about deadlines, approvals, anomalies, and dozens of other things. You probably don't want all of them. Here's how to configure what reaches you.

## Notification Channels

You can receive notifications via:

**In-app** — Badge on the bell icon in Pluvel. Good for things you'll see next time you log in.

**Email** — Sent to your account email. Good for things that need attention even if you're not in Pluvel.

**Mobile push** — If you have the Pluvel app installed. Good for urgent stuff.

**Slack** (if integrated) — Posts to a channel. Good for team visibility.

Each notification type can be configured separately per channel.

## Configuring Notifications

Go to **Settings → Notifications**.

You'll see each notification type with toggles for:
- In-app (on/off)
- Email (on/off)
- Push (on/off)

For some notifications, you can set thresholds:
- Cash alert: when balance falls below $____
- Large transaction: amounts over $____
- Budget alert: at ___% of budget

## Digest vs. Immediate

Some notifications can be batched:

**Immediate** — As soon as it happens. Good for urgent things (low cash, payment failures).

**Daily digest** — One email per day with everything from the last 24 hours. Good for non-urgent updates.

**Weekly summary** — Once per week. Good for things you want to track but don't need to act on immediately.

Choose based on how quickly you need to act.

## Team Notifications

If you have team members, you can configure who gets what:

- **Owner notifications** — Only the account owner (deadlines, compliance, IRS stuff)
- **Admin notifications** — All admins (approvals, payroll)
- **Personal notifications** — Each person (their own expenses, tasks assigned to them)

Configure team notification routing in **Settings → Team → Notification Routing**.

## Snooze and Mute

**Snooze** — Temporarily silence a specific notification. "Remind me about this invoice in 3 days."

**Mute** — Permanently hide a specific item. "Stop telling me about this old invoice."

Right-click (or long-press on mobile) any notification to access these options.

## Do Not Disturb

Going on vacation? Turn on DND:

1. **Settings → Notifications → Do Not Disturb**
2. Set start and end dates
3. Choose what still gets through (only critical, or nothing)

Critical notifications (like bank account issues or IRS letters) can optionally bypass DND.

<Warning>
Be careful with DND during compliance deadlines. You might miss something important. Consider delegating to a team member instead of fully muting.
</Warning>

## Email Preferences

If you're getting too many emails:

- Switch non-urgent items to daily digest
- Turn off email for things you can check in-app
- Unsubscribe from marketing (separate from operational emails)

We never send marketing to operational email preferences. "Your invoice is overdue" and "Check out our new feature" are separate settings.
