description: Manage multiple companies from one Pluvel account.
---

You have an LLC for your consulting business, another for your rental property, and you're about to start a third for a new venture. Managing separate logins for each one is a hassle.

One Pluvel account handles all of them. Switch between companies with a click — each has its own completely separate books, bank connections, and settings, but you only need one login.

## Add another company

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the company switcher">
    Click your company name in the top navigation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Add Company">
    Click **Add Company** at the bottom of the dropdown.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose company type">
    - **Form a New Company** — Start a new business
    - **Add Existing Company** — Add a business you already have
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete setup">
    Follow the setup process for the new company.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Switch between companies

### Using the company switcher

1. Click your company name in the top navigation
2. Select the company you want to view
3. Dashboard updates to show that company's data

### Keyboard shortcut

Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) to open the command palette, then type the company name.

## What's separate between companies

Each company is completely separate:

| Data | Separate per company |
|------|---------------------|
| Bank accounts | ✓ |
| Transactions | ✓ |
| Invoices | ✓ |
| Customers | ✓ |
| Vendors | ✓ |
| Employees | ✓ |
| Reports | ✓ |
| Compliance | ✓ |
| Settings | ✓ |

You cannot combine data across companies or transfer transactions between them.

## What's shared

Some things are account-level (not company-specific):

| Feature | Shared across companies |
|---------|------------------------|
| Your login credentials | ✓ |
| Team members | Per company (must invite separately) |
| Billing | Per company (each billed separately) |

## Use cases

### Multiple businesses

If you own several businesses (even related ones), each should be its own company in Pluvel:
- Separate legal entities
- Separate books and taxes
- Clear liability separation

### Holding company structure

If you have a holding company with subsidiaries:
- Add each entity separately
- Maintain separate books
- Switch between them as needed

### Managing client companies

Accountants and bookkeepers can add client companies:
- Each client is a separate company
- Switch between clients easily
- Consider [Firm Mode](/accountants/overview) for a better multi-client experience

## Company order

The company switcher shows companies in the order you added them. To reorder:

1. Go to **Settings → Account**
2. Find **Company Order**
3. Drag companies to reorder
4. Save

Your most-used company can be at the top.

## Remove a company

If you no longer need a company:

1. Switch to that company
2. Go to **Settings → Company**
3. Scroll to bottom
4. Click **Delete Company**
5. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
Deletion is permanent. All data for that company is erased. Export your data first if needed.
</Warning>

## Billing

Each company has its own subscription:
- Add a company → starts a trial
- Upgrade each company separately
- View individual billing in each company's settings

For accountants with many clients, [Firm Mode billing](/accountants/billing/how-it-works) offers volume pricing.
