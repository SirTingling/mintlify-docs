A bank wants your EIN. A vendor needs your legal address. The state wants to know where you operate. Your invoice says one company name, but your formation documents say another. Where's the source of truth?

Your company profile is it. Legal name, addresses, tax IDs, formation details — all in one place. When you update something here, it flows through to invoices, tax filings, and compliance documents.

## Basic Information

Go to **Company → Details** to view and edit:

| Field | What It's Used For |
|-------|-------------------|
| Legal name | Tax filings, legal documents |
| DBA (doing business as) | Invoices, customer-facing materials |
| Entity type | LLC, Corporation, etc. |
| State of formation | Where you registered |
| Formation date | When the entity was created |
| EIN | Federal tax ID |
| State tax IDs | State-specific identifiers |

Most of this is set when you form or add your company. You can update the DBA and operational details anytime. Legal details like entity type require formal changes (and possibly state filings).

## Addresses

Your company may have several addresses:

**Legal address** — Where your registered agent receives official documents. This is often a registered agent's address, not your home or office.

**Mailing address** — Where you want regular mail sent. Can be the same as legal or different.

**Physical address** — Where you actually operate. Required for some state filings and may affect where you pay taxes.

Keep these updated. Outdated addresses mean missed mail, missed filings, and potential compliance issues.

<Info>
If you use Pluvel as your registered agent, we provide the legal address. You can still set a separate mailing address for non-legal correspondence.

## Contact Information

**Primary contact** — The person responsible for the company in Pluvel. Usually the owner.

**Phone number** — Business phone for official communications.

**Email** — Where important notifications go.

**Website** — Shows on invoices and marketing materials.

This contact info may be used on state filings, IRS correspondence, and official documents.

## Logo and Branding

Upload your company logo:

1. Go to **Company → Details → Branding**
2. Click **Upload Logo**
3. Choose a file (PNG or SVG, under 2MB)
4. Crop if needed

Your logo appears on:
- Invoices and estimates
- Customer portal
- Email communications
- Pay stubs (if you enable it)

You can also set brand colors if you want invoices and customer-facing pages to match your brand.

## Industry and NAICS Code

Some reports and compliance filings ask for your industry. Select from the dropdown or enter your NAICS code (the government's industry classification system).

Common codes:
- 541110 — Law firms
- 541510 — Computer systems design
- 722511 — Restaurants
- 531210 — Real estate brokers

Not sure? Google "NAICS code [your industry]" or ask your accountant.

## Fiscal Year

Most businesses use a calendar year (January - December). If you use a different fiscal year:

1. Go to **Company → Details → Fiscal Year**
2. Select your fiscal year end month
3. Save

Your reports, P&L statements, and year-end close will follow this schedule.

<Warning>
Changing your fiscal year mid-way has tax implications. Talk to your accountant before making this change.
</Warning>

## Multi-Entity Businesses

If you have multiple companies (holding company + operating company, multiple LLCs, etc.):

- Each entity has its own profile in Pluvel
- Switch between them using the company selector
- Data doesn't mix between entities unless you set up intercompany transfers

Related companies can optionally be linked for consolidated reporting.

## Updating Legal Details

Some changes require more than editing a field:

| Change | What's Required |
|--------|-----------------|
| Business name | State amendment filing |
| Entity type (LLC to Corp) | Conversion or new formation |
| State of formation | Domestication or new formation |
| Add new state registration | Foreign qualification |

Pluvel can help with these — go to **Formation → Amendments** or contact support.

## Sharing Company Information

Need to share your business details with a bank, vendor, or government agency?

**Company summary** — Download a PDF with your legal info, EIN, addresses, and formation details.

**Certificate of Good Standing** — Request through Pluvel (we fetch it from the state).

**IRS letters** — Access your EIN confirmation and other IRS correspondence in Documents.

Find these in **Company → Documents**.

## Data Privacy

Company information is visible to:
- Account owner (always)
- Admins (configurable)
- Team members (limited — they see what they need for their role)
- Your accountant (if connected via Firm Mode)

Configure who sees what in **Settings → Team → Permissions**.
