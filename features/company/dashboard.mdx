How's the business doing? It's a simple question, but answering it usually means opening three apps, running a few reports, and piecing together numbers from different places.

The dashboard puts it all on one screen: your cash position, what customers owe you, what you owe vendors, upcoming deadlines, and recent activity. Log in and immediately know what needs attention.

## Dashboard sections

Click any metric to see the underlying report.
