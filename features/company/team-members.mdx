description: Invite others to access your company in Pluvel.
---

You shouldn't be the only person who can categorize transactions, send invoices, or run payroll. But you also don't want your part-time assistant to have access to your bank accounts and tax filings.

Pluvel lets you invite team members with specific roles — from read-only viewers who can see reports, to admins who can do almost everything. Everyone gets their own login, and you control exactly what they can access.

## Roles

| Role | Access level |
|------|--------------|
| **Owner** | Full access including billing and ownership transfer |
| **Admin** | Full access except billing and ownership |
| **Member** | Day-to-day features (transactions, invoices, bills) |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to reports and data |
| **Accountant** | Special role for external accountants |

## Managing team members

### Change someone's role

1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Click on the team member
3. Select new role from dropdown
4. Save

### Remove someone

1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Click on the team member
3. Click **Remove**
4. Confirm

They immediately lose access. Their past actions remain in the audit log.

## Transfer ownership

To transfer ownership to another person:

1. Ensure they're already a team member (Admin level)
2. Go to **Settings → Team**
3. Click on their profile
4. Click **Transfer Ownership**
5. Confirm with your password

<Warning>
Ownership transfer is permanent. You'll become an Admin and lose billing access.
</Warning>

## Inviting your accountant

For external accountants or bookkeepers:

1. Invite them with the **Accountant** role
2. They get access to:
   - All financial data and reports
   - Transaction categorization
   - Bank reconciliation
3. They can't access billing or team settings

If your accountant manages multiple clients, they can use [Firm Mode](/accountants/overview) instead.

## Team activity log

See what team members have done:

1. Go to **Settings → Team → Activity Log**
2. View actions by team member
3. Filter by date range or action type

Logged actions include:
- Invoices created/sent
- Transactions categorized
- Settings changed
- Reports exported

## Security best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use strong passwords">
    Each team member should use a unique, strong password. Consider requiring password managers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable 2FA">
    Strongly recommend all team members enable two-factor authentication. Admins can require it for the whole team.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review access regularly">
    Quarterly, review who has access. Remove people who no longer need it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use appropriate roles">
    Don't give everyone Admin access. Use the minimum role needed for their job.
  </Accordion>
