description: Switch your registered agent to Pluvel.
---

You're paying $100-$300/year for a registered agent that does one thing: accepts mail and forwards it to you. Maybe they send you an email when something arrives. Maybe they don't. Your formation documents, tax filings, and compliance records are scattered across multiple platforms.

Transferring to Pluvel consolidates everything — registered agent, compliance tracking, document storage, mail scanning — in one place, included in your subscription.

## When to change agents

Common reasons to switch:

- **Consolidation** — Want everything in one platform
- **Cost** — Your current agent charges more
- **Service** — Need better notification and scanning
- **Moving states** — Re-domiciling your business

## How to transfer

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the transfer">
    Go to **Settings → Company → Registered Agent** and click **Transfer to Pluvel**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide current agent info">
    Enter your current registered agent's name and address so we know what to update.
  </Step>

  <Step title="We file the change">
    We file a Change of Registered Agent form with your state. You sign electronically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="State processes">
    The state updates your records. Timing varies (1-10 business days).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transfer complete">
    You're notified when complete. All future mail comes to us.

## What happens to old mail

Mail sent to your old registered agent after the transfer:

- **Before state update** — Old agent should forward to you
- **After state update** — Mail comes to Pluvel

<Warning>
Notify your previous agent of the change. Some may continue forwarding mail; others won't.
