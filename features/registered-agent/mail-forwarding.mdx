Your registered agent address is on file with the state. Government agencies, courts, and anyone who looks up your business can send mail there. But you're not at that address — so how do you know when something arrives?

We scan every piece of mail and put it in your dashboard within 24 hours. You get an email notification with a preview. If you need the physical document, we ship it to you.
