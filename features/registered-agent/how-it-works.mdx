description: Understand what a registered agent does and how Pluvel handles it.
---

The state needs someone to accept legal documents for your business. Lawsuit papers, tax notices, compliance reminders — someone has to receive them and make sure you know about them. If that someone isn't available, you might miss a lawsuit deadline and lose by default.

That's what a registered agent does. Every LLC and corporation is legally required to have one, and Pluvel handles it so you don't have to be tied to a physical address during business hours.

## What a registered agent does

Your registered agent:

- **Receives service of process** — If someone sues your business, the lawsuit papers are delivered to your registered agent
- **Accepts state correspondence** — Annual report notices, tax documents, and compliance reminders
- **Maintains a physical address** — Must be a street address (not a PO Box) in your state of formation
- **Is available during business hours** — Someone must be present to accept documents Monday-Friday, 9-5

## Why you need one

Every state requires LLCs and corporations to designate a registered agent. The registered agent:

- Creates a reliable contact point for legal matters
- Ensures you don't miss important deadlines
- Provides an address for your public filings

<Warning>
If you don't have a registered agent, your business can lose good standing, and you may not receive notice of lawsuits filed against you.
</Warning>

## Service of process

If your business is served with a lawsuit:

1. **We accept service** — The process server delivers papers to our office
2. **Immediate notification** — You receive an urgent alert (email, SMS if enabled)
3. **Scanned copy** — Document uploaded to your dashboard within hours
4. **Physical forwarding** — Original documents shipped to you via overnight mail
5. **Deadline tracking** — We note the response deadline in your compliance calendar

<Info>
Service of process triggers immediate notification, not next-business-day. We understand the urgency.
