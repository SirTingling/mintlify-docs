Cash is tight this week. You have $12,000 in bills coming due, but only $8,000 in the bank. Which vendors can wait? Which ones will cut you off if you're late? Which ones offer early-payment discounts you're missing?

The AP Aging report answers these questions. It shows what you owe, when it's due, and how long it's been outstanding — so you can manage cash flow instead of reacting to angry vendor emails.

## Accessing the report

1. Go to **Reports** in the sidebar
2. Click **AP Aging** (under Payables)
3. View as of today or select a different date

## Understanding aging

### Current

Bills within their payment terms. No action needed yet, but plan for these payments.

### 1-30 days past due

Recently overdue. Pay soon to maintain good vendor relationships. May incur late fees.

### 31-60 days past due

Attention needed. Vendors may limit your credit or require payment before new orders.

### 61-90 days past due

Significant concern. Vendor relationships at risk. May affect your credit.

### 90+ days past due

Critical. May face collections, service cutoffs, or legal action.

| < 30 | Paying quickly, good relationships |
| 30-45 | Balanced approach |
| 45-60 | Stretching payments |
| > 60 | May strain vendor relationships |

## Cash flow management

Use AP aging for cash planning:

### Weekly payment runs

1. Review AP aging every week
2. Prioritize overdue bills
3. Schedule payments for due-soon bills
4. Consider cash position before paying early

### Early payment discounts

Some vendors offer discounts for early payment:

| Terms | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 2/10 Net 30 | 2% discount if paid in 10 days, else full amount in 30 |
| 1/15 Net 45 | 1% discount if paid in 15 days, else full amount in 45 |

Track these in the bill details. The report can filter bills with early pay discounts available.

## Payment prioritization

When cash is tight, prioritize:

1. **Payroll** — Always first (legal obligation)
2. **Taxes** — Penalties compound quickly
3. **Critical vendors** — Those who can shut down operations
4. **Lease/rent** — Avoid eviction
5. **Utilities** — Avoid service disruption
6. **Other vendors** — Negotiate if needed

## Vendor relationships

### Communicating about late payments

If you can't pay on time:

1. Contact vendor before the due date
2. Explain the situation
3. Propose a payment plan
4. Get agreement in writing

### Tracking vendor terms

See payment terms for each vendor in **Vendors** section. Update terms when negotiated.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I reduce AP aging?">
    - Set up payment schedules
    - Pay bills on due date (not before or after)
    - Use auto-pay for recurring bills
    - Reconcile bills promptly when received
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I always pay early?">
    Not necessarily. Use full payment terms unless:
    - Early payment discounts are offered
    - You want to strengthen the relationship
    - You have excess cash

    Paying too early ties up working capital.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are partial payments shown?">
    The report shows remaining balance. If a $1,000 bill has a $400 payment, it shows $600 outstanding.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about credit card bills?">
    Credit card statements appear as bills when imported or entered. The balance shows in AP until paid.
