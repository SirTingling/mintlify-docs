Your CFO wants to see monthly revenue by customer segment. Your ops team needs payroll costs by department. Your board wants a specific format they've used for years. None of these are standard reports.

Custom reports let you build exactly what you need — pick the data, set the filters, choose the grouping, and save it for next time. If you can imagine it, you can probably build it.
