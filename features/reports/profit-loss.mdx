"We're bringing in money, but it feels like there's never anything left." Sound familiar? Revenue doesn't equal profit — you need to see what's actually happening between money coming in and money going out.

The Profit & Loss (P&L) report — also called an Income Statement — shows exactly that: your revenue, your costs, and what's left over. It answers the simplest question in business: "Did we make money or lose money?"

## Accessing the P&L

1. Go to **Reports** in the sidebar
2. Click **Profit & Loss**
3. Select your date range

## Report structure

The P&L follows a standard structure:

```
Revenue
  - Product Sales
  - Service Revenue
  - Other Income
= Gross Revenue

Less: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
  - Materials
  - Direct Labor
= Gross Profit

Less: Operating Expenses
  - Payroll
  - Rent
  - Utilities
  - Marketing
  - Software
  - Insurance
  - Professional Services
= Operating Income (EBIT)

Less: Other Expenses
  - Interest Expense
  - Depreciation
= Net Income (Profit/Loss)
```

## Key metrics

| Metric | Formula | What It Tells You |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Gross Revenue | Sum of all income | Total money earned |
| Gross Profit | Revenue - COGS | Profit before overhead |
| Gross Margin | Gross Profit / Revenue | Efficiency of production |
| Operating Income | Gross Profit - OpEx | Profit from core operations |
| Net Income | Total Revenue - Total Expenses | Bottom line |
| Net Margin | Net Income / Revenue | Overall profitability |

## Cash vs. Accrual

Toggle between accounting methods:

| Method | Revenue Recognized | Expenses Recognized |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Cash | When received | When paid |
| Accrual | When earned | When incurred |

<Info>
Your default method is set in **Settings → Accounting**. The toggle lets you see both views without changing your books.
</Info>

### Why it matters

Cash basis may show:
- Lower revenue (unpaid invoices excluded)
- Lower expenses (unpaid bills excluded)

Accrual basis shows:
- True earned revenue
- True incurred expenses
- More accurate matching

## Categorization impact

The P&L is only as accurate as your categorization:

- **Uncategorized transactions** appear as "Other Income" or "Other Expenses"
- Review and categorize regularly for accurate reporting
- Use bank rules to automate recurring categorization

Go to **Banking → Transactions** to categorize.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why doesn't my P&L match my bank balance?">
    The P&L shows income and expenses, not cash flow. Differences include:
    - Unpaid invoices (accrual basis)
    - Accounts payable (bills not yet paid)
    - Loan principal (not an expense)
    - Owner draws (not an expense)
    - Asset purchases (capitalized, not expensed)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between COGS and Operating Expenses?">
    COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) are costs directly tied to producing what you sell—materials, direct labor. Operating expenses are overhead—rent, utilities, marketing. COGS varies with sales volume; OpEx is more fixed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I add budget figures?">
    Go to **Settings → Accounting → Budgets**. Enter monthly budget amounts per category. Then use Compare → Budget on reports.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are some categories missing?">
    Only categories with transactions in the selected period appear. To see all categories (including zeros), click **Show All Accounts**.
