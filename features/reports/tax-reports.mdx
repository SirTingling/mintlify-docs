It's tax season. Your accountant asks for income summaries, expense breakdowns, contractor payments, depreciation schedules, payroll totals — and they needed it yesterday. You could spend a week pulling numbers from different places, or you could export everything in one click.

Tax reports give you and your accountant exactly what you need for returns, estimated payments, and audits. The data is organized by what the IRS and state agencies actually want to see.
