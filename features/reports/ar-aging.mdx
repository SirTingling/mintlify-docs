You sent the invoice 45 days ago. The payment was due 15 days ago. You're not sure if you followed up, or when, or whether they even received it. Now multiply that by 20 customers and $80,000 in outstanding invoices.

The AR Aging report shows exactly who owes you money, how much, and how long it's been overdue. It's the first place to look when cash is tight — because money you've already earned is sitting in other people's bank accounts.

## Accessing the report

1. Go to **Reports** in the sidebar
2. Click **AR Aging** (under Receivables)
3. View as of today or select a different date

## Report structure

The report groups outstanding invoices by age:

| Column | Invoices |
|--------|----------|
| Current | Not yet due |
| 1-30 Days | 1-30 days past due |
| 31-60 Days | 31-60 days past due |
| 61-90 Days | 61-90 days past due |
| 90+ Days | More than 90 days past due |

### Example

| Customer | Current | 1-30 | 31-60 | 61-90 | 90+ | Total |
|----------|---------|------|-------|-------|-----|-------|
| Acme Corp | $2,500 | $1,200 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $3,700 |
| Beta Inc | $0 | $0 | $3,400 | $0 | $0 | $3,400 |
| Gamma LLC | $5,000 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $2,100 | $7,100 |
| **Total** | **$7,500** | **$1,200** | **$3,400** | **$0** | **$2,100** | **$14,200** |

## Understanding aging

### Current

Invoices within their payment terms—not yet due. No action needed unless terms are about to expire.

### 1-30 days past due

Recently overdue. Send a friendly reminder. Most invoices get paid in this window.

### 31-60 days past due

Attention needed. Follow up more persistently. Consider calling instead of just emailing.

### 61-90 days past due

Significant concern. Personal outreach, payment plans, or escalation may be needed.

### 90+ days past due

High risk. May need collection efforts, legal action, or write-off consideration.

## Using for collections

### Prioritization

Focus collection efforts on:
1. **Largest amounts** — Biggest impact on cash
2. **Oldest invoices** — Hardest to collect
3. **Good customers** — Likely to pay with reminder

### Collection workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Current to 30 days">
    Automatic reminder email on day 1 past due.
  </Step>

  <Step title="30-45 days">
    Personal email or phone call. Ask if there's an issue.
  </Step>

  <Step title="45-60 days">
    Escalate to decision-maker. Offer payment plan if needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="60-90 days">
    Formal demand letter. Consider stopping service.
  </Step>

  <Step title="90+ days">
    Final notice. Send to collections or write off.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing off bad debt

If an invoice is uncollectible:

1. Click the invoice
2. Click **Write Off**
3. Confirm the write-off
4. Entry recorded to Bad Debt Expense

<Warning>
Only write off invoices after genuine collection efforts. Write-offs reduce income and taxes but also show collection problems.
</Warning>

## Common questions
