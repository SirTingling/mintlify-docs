A bank asks for your financial statements before approving a loan. An investor wants to see your books before writing a check. Your accountant needs a year-end snapshot for taxes. They're all asking for the same thing: your Balance Sheet.

The Balance Sheet shows your company's financial position at a specific point in time. What do you own? What do you owe? What's left for the owners?

## The fundamental equation

```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

This equation always balances—hence "balance sheet."

## Accessing the Balance Sheet

1. Go to **Reports** in the sidebar
2. Click **Balance Sheet**
3. Select the "as of" date

## Report structure

### Assets

What your company owns:

```
Current Assets
  - Cash and Cash Equivalents
  - Accounts Receivable
  - Inventory
  - Prepaid Expenses

Long-Term Assets
  - Property and Equipment
  - Less: Accumulated Depreciation
  - Intangible Assets

= Total Assets
```

### Liabilities

What your company owes:

```
Current Liabilities
  - Accounts Payable
  - Credit Cards
  - Accrued Expenses
  - Payroll Liabilities
  - Current Portion of Long-Term Debt

Long-Term Liabilities
  - Loans Payable
  - Notes Payable

= Total Liabilities
```

### Equity

What's left for owners:

```
Owner's Equity
  - Owner Contributions
  - Retained Earnings
  - Current Year Earnings
  - Owner Draws

= Total Equity
```

- Additional investments
- Does NOT include profits

### Retained earnings

Accumulated profits from prior years:
- Auto-calculated by Pluvel
- Rolls forward each year-end

### Current year earnings

This year's profit or loss:
- Equals your year-to-date P&L net income
- At year-end, moves to Retained Earnings

### Owner draws/distributions

Money taken out by owners:
- Reduces equity
- Not an expense (doesn't reduce profit)
- Important for personal tax planning

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why doesn't my cash match my bank statement?">
    Possible reasons:
    - Outstanding checks (issued but not cashed)
    - Deposits in transit
    - Unrecorded transactions
    - Timing differences

    Reconcile your accounts regularly to match.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are Retained Earnings?">
    Retained Earnings accumulate your company's profits (minus distributions) from all prior years. Each year-end, current year earnings roll into Retained Earnings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why doesn't my Balance Sheet balance?">
    It should always balance. If it doesn't:
    - Check for journal entry errors
    - Look for one-sided transactions
    - Contact support if persistent

    Pluvel enforces double-entry accounting, so imbalances are rare.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I record depreciation?">
    Depreciation is recorded via journal entry:
    - Debit: Depreciation Expense (P&L)
    - Credit: Accumulated Depreciation (Balance Sheet)

    Go to **Accounting → Journal Entries** to record.
  </Accordion>
