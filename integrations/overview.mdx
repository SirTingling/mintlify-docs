---

Your bank transactions are in one place. Stripe payments in another. Payroll data somewhere else. Shopify orders in a fourth tab. Getting a complete picture of your finances means logging into five different tools and manually piecing it together.

Integrations fix that. Connect the tools you already use — banking, payments, payroll, e-commerce, accounting — and the data flows into Pluvel automatically. One place, one view, no copy-pasting.

## How integrations work

### Connecting

Most integrations use OAuth — you click "Connect," log in to the service, and authorize Pluvel to access your data. We never see your passwords.

A few integrations (like Mercury) use API keys that you generate in that service's dashboard and paste into Pluvel.

### Syncing

Integrations sync data in two ways:

**Real-time (webhooks):** Services like Stripe and Gusto push updates to Pluvel immediately. A new payment appears in Pluvel within seconds.

**Periodic (polling):** We pull data on a schedule — typically hourly for banking, daily for others. You can trigger a manual sync anytime.

### Data ownership

Your data stays yours. Connecting an integration doesn't give us ownership of anything. If you disconnect, we stop syncing new data but keep what's already imported (so your books stay intact).

## Managing integrations

All integrations are managed in **Settings → Integrations**.

For each connected integration, you can:

- **View status** — Connection health, last sync time, any errors
- **Sync now** — Trigger an immediate sync
- **Configure** — Adjust settings specific to that integration
- **Disconnect** — Remove the connection (keeps existing data)
