description: Migrate your accounting data from QuickBooks Online.
---

You've been running QuickBooks for years. Hundreds of customers. Thousands of transactions. A chart of accounts you've carefully built up. Now you want to move to Pluvel, but the thought of starting over from scratch makes you want to lie down.

Good news: you don't have to recreate anything. Connect your QuickBooks account and we'll import everything — chart of accounts, customers, vendors, invoices, bills, and your entire transaction history.

## What comes over

| Data | What imports |
|------|--------------|
| **Chart of Accounts** | All accounts with hierarchy intact |
| **Customers** | Names, addresses, contact info, outstanding balances |
| **Vendors** | Names, addresses, contact info, what you owe them |
| **Products/Services** | Items, prices, descriptions |
| **Invoices** | Open and paid — your full receivables history |
| **Bills** | Open and paid — your full payables history |
| **Journal entries** | Historical transactions |
| **Bank transactions** | Everything you've already categorized |

<Info>
This is a one-time migration, not an ongoing sync. After importing, Pluvel becomes your system of record. Changes you make in QuickBooks won't appear in Pluvel.
</Info>

## Before you connect

A little prep work makes the import cleaner:

1. **Reconcile your accounts** — Unreconciled transactions can cause balance mismatches
2. **Clean up unused accounts** — That "Test Account" from 2019 doesn't need to migrate
3. **Run comparison reports** — Export your current P&L and Balance Sheet so you can verify after import
4. **Know your fiscal year** — We need to know when your year starts

## Connect QuickBooks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the connection">
    Go to **Settings → Integrations**, find QuickBooks in the Accounting section, and click **Connect**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign into QuickBooks">
    You'll be redirected to Intuit. Log in with your QuickBooks Online credentials and select the company to connect.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize Pluvel">
    Grant permission for Pluvel to read your QuickBooks data. We only request read access — we can't make changes to your QuickBooks account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose what to import">
    Select which data types to bring over. We recommend importing everything for a complete migration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map your accounts">
    Review how QuickBooks accounts map to Pluvel's chart of accounts. Most map automatically, but you can adjust any that need different treatment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the import">
    Click **Import** and let it run. You'll get an email when it's done.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How accounts map

Your QuickBooks account types translate to Pluvel like this:

| QuickBooks type | Pluvel type |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Bank | Assets - Cash and Bank |
| Accounts Receivable | Assets - Receivables |
| Other Current Asset | Assets - Current Assets |
| Fixed Asset | Assets - Fixed Assets |
| Accounts Payable | Liabilities - Payables |
| Credit Card | Liabilities - Credit Cards |
| Other Current Liability | Liabilities - Current |
| Long Term Liability | Liabilities - Long-Term |
| Equity | Equity |
| Income | Revenue |
| Cost of Goods Sold | Expenses - COGS |
| Expense | Expenses |
| Other Income | Other Income |
| Other Expense | Other Expenses |

## How long it takes

| Company size | Typical duration |
|--------------|------------------|
| Small (under 1,000 transactions) | 5-10 minutes |
| Medium (1,000-10,000 transactions) | 15-30 minutes |
| Large (10,000+ transactions) | 1-2 hours |

You'll see a progress indicator. For large imports, you can close the browser and we'll email you when it's done.

## QuickBooks features that need attention

### Classes and locations

QuickBooks classes import as tracking categories in Pluvel. You can use them the same way for departmental reporting.

### Inventory

If you track inventory in QuickBooks, your items import with quantities and values. Pluvel supports basic inventory tracking for invoicing purposes.

### Sales tax

Sales tax settings don't automatically transfer. You'll need to configure your sales tax in Pluvel after the import.

### Recurring transactions

Recurring invoices and bills don't import. You'll recreate them in Pluvel — it takes about 5 minutes each.

## Verify your import

After importing, check that everything came through correctly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Compare trial balances">
    Run a trial balance in both systems. Total debits should equal total credits, and the totals should match between systems.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check your P&L">
    Run a P&L for the same date range in both systems. Revenue and expenses should match.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review open invoices">
    Your total outstanding receivables should be the same.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Spot-check customer balances">
    Pick 3-4 customers with open balances and verify they match.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Import is taking forever">
    Large imports can take up to 2 hours. You'll get an email when complete. Don't disconnect or start another import while one is running.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Account balances don't match">
    Common causes:

    - Unreconciled transactions in QuickBooks
    - Transactions entered after you started the import
    - Pending transactions that haven't posted yet

    Run reports for the same exact date range in both systems to compare apples to apples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing transactions">
    We import transactions from the start of your current fiscal year. Older transactions become opening balances. If you need full historical detail, contact support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate accounts">
    If you accidentally imported twice, you'll see duplicate accounts. Merge them in **Settings → Accounting → Chart of Accounts**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Products didn't come over">
    Products/services only import if you selected that option. You can run a partial import for just products if you missed them.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## QuickBooks Desktop users

We support QuickBooks **Online** only. If you're on QuickBooks Desktop:

1. **Convert to QuickBooks Online first** — Intuit offers a conversion tool
2. **Then connect to Pluvel** — Use this standard integration
3. **Or export as CSV** — Export your data as CSV files and import manually

## After migration

Once everything is verified:

1. **Stop entering new transactions in QuickBooks** — All new activity goes in Pluvel
2. **Keep QuickBooks active for a month** — In case you need to reference anything
3. **Download any reports you want** — Export them before you cancel
4. **Then cancel your QuickBooks subscription**
