description: Import employee and payroll data from ADP.
---

You've been running payroll through ADP — maybe ADP Run, maybe Workforce Now. Hundreds of payroll runs, complex benefits, multi-state taxes. Now you want to switch, but the idea of recreating all that employee data makes you tired.

Connect your ADP account and we'll import your employees, pay history, tax withholdings, and deductions. Your YTD totals come over so your next payroll calculates correctly.

## What imports

| Data | What comes over |
|------|-----------------|
| **Employees** | Names, addresses, pay rates, tax info |
| **Pay history** | YTD earnings and deductions |
| **Tax withholdings** | Federal and state W-4 data |
| **Direct deposit** | Bank account information |
| **Deductions** | Benefit deductions and amounts |

<Info>
This is a migration integration. It imports your historical data — future payrolls run in Pluvel, not ADP.
</Info>

## Supported ADP products

We can import from:

- ADP Run
- ADP Workforce Now
- ADP TotalSource (PEO)

<Warning>
ADP TotalSource migrations are more complex since you're leaving a PEO arrangement. You're not just switching software — you're becoming the employer of record. Contact support for guidance.
</Warning>

## Before you connect

Make the migration smoother:

1. **Get admin credentials** — You need ADP admin access, not just employee access
2. **Run pending payrolls** — Complete any in-progress payrolls in ADP first
3. **Download reports** — Export any reports you want to keep
4. **Know your pay schedule** — Note your current pay dates

## Connect ADP

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the connection">
    Go to **Settings → Integrations**, find ADP in the Payroll section, and click **Connect**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select your ADP product">
    Tell us which ADP you're using — Run, Workforce Now, or TotalSource.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize access">
    Log into ADP and authorize Pluvel to access your data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose what to import">
    Select the data to bring over:
    - Active employees
    - Terminated employees (optional, useful for YTD reporting)
    - Payroll history
    - Deduction setup
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and import">
    Preview what's coming over, then click **Import**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How fields map

| ADP field | Pluvel field |
|-----------|--------------|
| Associate ID | Employee ID |
| Legal name | Full name |
| Work address | Office location |
| Pay rate | Salary/hourly rate |
| Federal filing status | W-4 status |
| State tax code | State withholding |

## Handling ADP-specific features

### Company codes

If you have multiple company codes in ADP, each imports as a separate entity in Pluvel. You can merge them or keep them separate depending on how you want to structure things.

### Departments and cost centers

ADP department codes import as departments in Pluvel. Cost center allocations import if you use our cost tracking features.

### Benefit deductions

Pre-tax and post-tax deductions import with their types:

| ADP deduction type | Pluvel equivalent |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| 401(k) | Retirement - 401(k) |
| Health insurance | Benefits - Health |
| HSA | Benefits - HSA |
| Garnishments | Deductions - Garnishment |

## How long it takes

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Data export from ADP | 1-2 days |
| Import and validation | 1 day |
| Employee verification | 2-3 days |
| First Pluvel payroll | Your next pay date |

Start the process 2-3 weeks before you want to run your first Pluvel payroll. Don't rush it.

## Canceling ADP

After you've successfully run payroll in Pluvel:

1. **Confirm data accuracy** — Verify YTD totals match between systems
2. **Run 2-3 payrolls** — Make sure everything works correctly
3. **Cancel ADP** — Follow ADP's cancellation process
4. **Keep records** — ADP retains historical data for compliance

<Warning>
Don't cancel ADP until you've verified Pluvel is working correctly. Keep both systems active during the transition period. Better safe than sorry.
</Warning>

## Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't connect to ADP">
    Common culprits:

    - You need admin-level access in ADP, not just employee self-service
    - Multi-factor authentication must be completed
    - Some ADP configurations require API access to be enabled

    Contact ADP support to verify your account has API access enabled.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing employees">
    Only active employees import by default. To include terminated employees, select "Include terminated" during import — useful for accurate YTD reporting if you've had turnover.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deductions not matching">
    Complex deduction setups may require manual verification. Compare each employee's deduction amounts with their ADP pay stub. Some custom deduction types may need manual mapping.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pay rate discrepancies">
    ADP stores multiple pay rates (regular, overtime multipliers, shift differentials). We import the base rate. Overtime calculations in Pluvel follow standard rules (1.5x for overtime, 2x for double-time in California, etc.).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What doesn't import

Some ADP features don't have Pluvel equivalents:

- Time and attendance data (import from your time tracking system)
- Performance reviews
- Learning management courses
- Benefits enrollment details (just deduction amounts, not plan specifics)
