Manually entering every transaction from your bank statement is a fantastic way to waste hours of your life and probably make a few typos in the process.

Plaid connects your bank accounts to Pluvel securely. Your transactions import automatically — up to 24 months of history — and new transactions sync daily. You never share your password with us.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Connect Bank">
    In Pluvel, go to **Settings → Banking** and click **Connect Bank Account**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find your bank">
    Plaid shows a search interface. Find your bank by name — over 12,000 financial institutions are supported.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log in through Plaid">
    Enter your online banking credentials in Plaid's secure window. Pluvel never sees your password.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select accounts">
    Choose which accounts to connect — checking, savings, credit cards. You don't have to connect everything.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transactions start syncing">
    Pluvel imports up to 24 months of history and syncs new transactions daily.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Plaid can and can't see

When you connect through Plaid, we receive:

| We receive | Used for |
|------------|----------|
| Account balances | Cash position, reconciliation |
| Transaction history | Categorization, reporting |
| Account details | Account name, type, last 4 digits |

We do **not** receive:

- Your login credentials
- Full account numbers
- Ability to move money

<Info>
Plaid uses read-only access. We can see your transactions but cannot initiate transfers, payments, or any changes to your accounts.
</Info>

## Which banks work

Plaid supports over 12,000 US financial institutions:

- Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi
- Capital One, US Bank, PNC, TD Bank
- Most credit unions
- Most regional banks

Some banks offer direct integrations with better reliability:

- **Mercury** — [Use our direct integration](/integrations/mercury) for real-time sync

## How often transactions sync

| Sync type | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| Automatic | Every 6-12 hours |
| Manual | On-demand (click Sync Now) |
| Initial import | Up to 24 months of history |

<Tip>
New transactions usually appear within a few hours. Need them sooner? Click **Sync Now** in your banking settings.
</Tip>

## Is this actually secure?

Plaid is trusted by thousands of financial apps and used by major companies like Venmo, Coinbase, and Robinhood. Here's how your data is protected:

- **Your password is never shared with us** — You log in directly to Plaid's secure interface
- **We receive a token, not credentials** — If Pluvel were breached, attackers couldn't access your bank
- **Everything is encrypted** — Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Plaid is SOC 2 Type II certified** — Regular security audits by independent firms
- **Read-only access** — Even with the connection, no one can move money

## Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My bank isn't listed">
    Try searching by the full name or alternate names. Some banks operate under different names in different regions.

    If it's genuinely not supported, you can add the account manually and import transactions via CSV.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection keeps disconnecting">
    Banks occasionally require re-authentication for security. This is normal and happens every few months with some banks.

    To reconnect:
    1. Go to **Settings → Banking**
    2. Click on the disconnected account
    3. Click **Reconnect**
    4. Log in again through Plaid
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transactions are delayed">
    Delays happen when:
    - Your bank is slow to report to Plaid (common with smaller banks)
    - The transaction is still pending
    - There's a temporary sync issue

    Try clicking **Sync Now**. If transactions are still missing after 24 hours, contact support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing historical transactions">
    Plaid imports up to 24 months, but some banks limit how far back they share data. For older transactions, import via CSV.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multi-factor authentication problems">
    If your bank uses MFA, you'll complete it during the Plaid connection process. Some banks require you to approve the connection in their mobile app.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Disconnecting

To disconnect a bank account:

1. Go to **Settings → Banking**
2. Click on the account
3. Click **Manage → Disconnect**

This stops future syncing but keeps all transactions you've already imported.

## Completely revoking access

To remove Plaid's access entirely:

1. Disconnect the account in Pluvel (above)
2. Visit [my.plaid.com](https://my.plaid.com) to manage all your Plaid connections
3. Find Pluvel and revoke access

You can also revoke through your bank's connected apps settings.
