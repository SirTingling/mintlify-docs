description: Migrate your accounting data from Xero.
---

You've built your entire accounting system in Xero. Contacts, invoices, bank rules, tracking categories — years of careful setup. The idea of recreating all that manually? No thank you.

Connect your Xero account and we'll bring everything over. Your chart of accounts, customers, suppliers, invoices, bills, and transaction history. Even your tracking categories survive the move.

## What comes over

| Data | What imports |
|------|--------------|
| **Chart of Accounts** | All accounts with hierarchy intact |
| **Contacts** | Customers and suppliers with full details |
| **Invoices** | Draft, sent, and paid invoices |
| **Bills** | Draft, awaiting payment, and paid bills |
| **Bank transactions** | Reconciled transactions with categories |
| **Manual journals** | All your journal entries |
| **Products** | Tracked and untracked items |
| **Tax rates** | Your tax configurations |

<Info>
This is a one-time migration. After importing, Pluvel becomes your system of record. Future changes in Xero won't sync.
</Info>

## Before you connect

Make the migration smoother with a bit of prep:

1. **Finish pending reconciliations** — Unreconciled items can cause balance mismatches
2. **Export comparison reports** — Run your P&L and Balance Sheet so you can verify after import
3. **Check your permissions** — You need Advisor or Standard user access in Xero
4. **Know your organization** — Which Xero org are you migrating?

## Connect Xero

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the connection">
    Go to **Settings → Integrations**, find Xero in the Accounting section, and click **Connect**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign into Xero">
    You'll be redirected to Xero. Log in with your credentials. If you manage multiple organizations, select the one you want to migrate.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize Pluvel">
    Grant permission for us to read your Xero data. We only request read access.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose what to import">
    Select which data types to bring over. We recommend importing everything.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review account mapping">
    Check how Xero accounts map to Pluvel. Most map automatically — adjust any that need different treatment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the import">
    Click **Import** and let it run.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How accounts map

Your Xero account classes translate to Pluvel:

| Xero class | Pluvel type |
|------------|-------------|
| ASSET | Assets |
| BANK | Assets - Cash and Bank |
| CURRENT | Assets - Current Assets |
| FIXED | Assets - Fixed Assets |
| LIABILITY | Liabilities |
| CURRLIAB | Liabilities - Current |
| TERMLIAB | Liabilities - Long-Term |
| EQUITY | Equity |
| REVENUE | Revenue |
| DIRECTCOSTS | Expenses - COGS |
| EXPENSE | Expenses |
| OVERHEADS | Expenses - Operating |

## Xero features that need attention

### Tracking categories

Your Xero tracking categories import as cost centers or departments. You can use them the same way for segmented reporting.

### Multi-currency

If you use multiple currencies in Xero, transactions import in their original currency. Set up the same currencies in Pluvel before importing so everything maps correctly.

### Repeating invoices and bills

Repeating transactions don't automatically import. You'll need to recreate them in Pluvel — about 2 minutes each.

### Projects

Xero Projects data imports as job/project tags on transactions. The structure is preserved.

### Payroll

Xero Payroll data doesn't migrate. Set up employees fresh in Pluvel Payroll, or use our Gusto/ADP import if you're moving from those systems.

## How long it takes

| Company size | Typical duration |
|--------------|------------------|
| Small (under 1,000 transactions) | 5-10 minutes |
| Medium (1,000-10,000 transactions) | 15-30 minutes |
| Large (10,000+ transactions) | 1-2 hours |

## Verify your import

After importing, make sure everything came through:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Compare trial balances">
    Run a trial balance in both systems. Totals should match.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check your P&L">
    Run a P&L for the same period in both systems.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify key balances">
    Check bank, AR, and AP balances specifically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review contacts">
    Spot-check a few customers and vendors to verify their info imported correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authorization failed">
    Check your Xero permissions:

    - You need Standard or Advisor user role
    - You need access to the specific organization

    If you're an Advisor, you need "full access" to the client organization, not just reporting access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organization doesn't appear">
    Only organizations you have access to show up. Check your Xero user permissions if one is missing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing transactions">
    We import transactions from the start of your current fiscal year. Earlier transactions become opening balances.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tax rates look wrong">
    Tax rates import, but you should verify them. Go to **Settings → Tax** to confirm your configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where are my bank feeds?">
    Xero bank feeds don't transfer — they're tied to your Xero account. Connect your banks to Pluvel directly via Plaid or our direct integrations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## After migration

Once everything checks out:

1. **Connect your bank accounts** — Set up Plaid connections so transactions flow into Pluvel
2. **Verify settings** — Check tax rates, fiscal year, and other settings
3. **Test the workflow** — Create a test invoice and bill to make sure everything works
4. **Keep Xero active for a month** — In case you need to reference anything

<Warning>
Don't cancel Xero until you've verified Pluvel is working correctly. Give it at least one full month-end close.
</Warning>

## Xero Practice Manager

If you use Xero Practice Manager (XPM), that data doesn't import. XPM is a separate product for accounting firms and isn't part of this migration.
