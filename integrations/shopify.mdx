description: Connect Shopify to sync orders, payouts, and sales data.
---

You're running an e-commerce business. Orders come in at all hours. Each one has product revenue, shipping charges, sales tax, maybe a discount. At the end of the week, Shopify deposits a lump sum into your bank account.

Which orders are in that deposit? What were your actual product sales vs. shipping revenue? How much sales tax did you collect for each state?

Connect Shopify and stop guessing. Every order syncs automatically with line-item detail, and we match your payouts to bank deposits so you always know exactly what you earned.

## What syncs

When you connect Shopify:

- **Orders import automatically** — Every sale creates a transaction in Pluvel
- **Payouts tracked** — When Shopify pays you, we match it to your bank deposit
- **Refunds recorded** — Refunds appear as negative transactions
- **Sales tax tracked** — Tax amounts by jurisdiction for your returns
- **Product revenue breakdown** — See exactly what sold

<Info>
Shopify syncs several times daily via API. New orders typically appear within a few hours.

## Connect Shopify

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the connection">
    Go to **Settings → Integrations**, find Shopify in the E-Commerce section, and click **Connect**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your store URL">
    Enter your Shopify store URL — the `yourstore.myshopify.com` one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize the app">
    You'll be redirected to Shopify. Log in and approve the Pluvel app.
  </Step>

    - Customers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initial import">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## How orders appear

Each Shopify order becomes a transaction in Pluvel:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Amount | Order total (including shipping and tax) |
| Date | Order date |
| Description | Customer name and order number |
| Category | Sales Revenue (by default) |
| Reference | Shopify order ID |

### Line-item breakdown

For each order, we create separate entries for:

- **Product revenue** — What you actually sold (before tax and shipping)
- **Shipping income** — If you charge for shipping
- **Sales tax** — Tax collected (broken out by jurisdiction)
- **Discounts** — Discount amounts (as negative revenue)

This means your reports show real product revenue, not just order totals.

## Matching payouts to bank deposits

Shopify batches orders and pays you every 1-2 business days. Here's how we connect the dots:

1. The Shopify payout appears in your integrations
2. The bank deposit appears via Plaid
3. Pluvel matches them automatically
4. You can see exactly which orders are in each payout

No more mystery deposits. That $12,847.32 bank deposit? Click it and see every order that's included.

## Sales tax tracking

If you collect sales tax through Shopify:

- Tax amounts import with each order
- Tax is tracked by jurisdiction (state, county, city)
- Use this data for your sales tax returns

## Multiple stores

Running multiple Shopify stores?

1. Connect each store separately
2. Each store's sales appear with a store tag
3. Reports can filter by store
4. Payouts reconcile per store

## Products and cost of goods sold

When you connect products, we import:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Product name | Transaction descriptions |
| SKU | Reference matching |
| Cost | Cost of goods sold (if entered in Shopify) |
| Price | Revenue tracking |

If you track product costs in Shopify, we can calculate COGS automatically. No more estimating gross margin.

## Managing the connection

### Check sync status

Go to **Settings → Integrations → Shopify** to see:

- Connection status
- Last sync time
- Orders synced
- Any errors

### Force a sync

Click **Sync Now** to pull recent orders immediately.

### Disconnect

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Shopify**
2. Click **Manage → Disconnect**

This stops syncing but keeps imported data.

To also remove from Shopify:
1. Go to Shopify Admin → Settings → Apps
2. Find Pluvel and click Remove

## Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Orders not syncing">
    If orders aren't appearing:

    1. Check that the app is still authorized in Shopify
    2. Try a manual sync
    3. Verify the orders are completed (draft orders don't sync)
    4. Look for error messages in integration settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Payout amounts don't match bank">
    Shopify payouts include orders minus fees and refunds. If amounts don't match:

    - Check for pending refunds
    - Verify Shopify Payments fees are accounted for
    - Look for chargebacks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate orders">
    Duplicates can happen if you import from multiple sources (Shopify integration + manual CSV). Use one method per time period.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing historical orders">
    Initial sync imports 90 days. Need older orders? Contact support for a one-time historical import.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test orders appearing">
    Shopify test orders (from Bogus Gateway) may import. Delete them manually or filter them out in reports.
  </Accordion>
