As your firm grows, you'll need staff with access to client accounts. Firm Staff lets you invite bookkeepers, accountants, and admins — each with appropriate permissions.

## Team Roles

| Role | Access Level |
|------|--------------|
| Firm Owner | Full access to everything. Billing, settings, all clients. |
| Firm Admin | Manage clients and staff. Can't access billing or firm settings. |
| Bookkeeper | Access to assigned clients. Transaction review, categorization, reconciliation. |
| Reviewer | Read-only access to assigned clients. Can view but not edit. |

Custom roles available on Scale plans.

## Inviting Team Members

Go to **Firm Settings → Team → Invite**.

1. Enter their email
2. Select a role
3. Assign clients (or "all clients")
4. Send invitation

They'll get an email to create their Pluvel account. Once they accept, they appear in your team list and can access assigned clients.

<Info>
Team members have their own login credentials. They don't share yours. You can see their activity in the audit log.

## Client Assignments

Not everyone needs to see every client. Assign staff to specific clients:

**By client:** Assign Team Member A to Client 1, 2, 3.

**By tag:** Assign Team Member A to all clients tagged "Bookkeeping" — new clients with that tag auto-assign.

**All clients:** Admins often have access to everyone.

Change assignments anytime in **Firm Settings → Team → [Person] → Clients**.

## Permissions

Within a role, you can further restrict access:

| Permission | Options |
|------------|---------|
| View transactions | Yes / No |
| Edit transactions | Yes / No |
| View documents | Yes / No |
| Upload documents | Yes / No |
| Run reports | Yes / No |
| Message clients | Yes / No |
| Manage billing | Owner only |

Example: A bookkeeper who can edit transactions but can't message clients directly.

Configure in **Firm Settings → Team → [Person] → Permissions**.

## Activity Tracking

See what your team is doing:

- **Activity feed** — Recent actions across all staff
- **By person** — Filter to see one person's actions
- **By client** — Who did what in this client's account

This helps with:
- Quality control (reviewing team member work)
- Training (seeing where people get stuck)
- Accountability (who made that change?)

Find this in **Firm Settings → Team → Activity Log**.

## Seat Management

Your plan includes a number of team seats:

| Plan | Included Seats |
|------|----------------|
| Firm Starter | 3 |
| Firm Growth | 10 |
| Firm Scale | Unlimited |

View current usage in **Firm Settings → Billing → Seats**.

## Removing Team Members

When someone leaves:

1. Go to **Firm Settings → Team**
2. Find the person
3. Click **Remove**

They immediately lose access to all clients. Their past activity stays in the audit log.

If you want to temporarily disable access without removing them entirely, use **Suspend** instead. They can be reactivated later without re-inviting.

## Transferring Clients

Staff member leaving? Transfer their clients:

1. Go to the team member's profile
2. Click **Transfer Clients**
3. Select the new assignee
4. Confirm

All their clients reassign to the new person. Nothing else changes — the clients' data stays the same.

## Tips

**Start narrow, expand later.** Give new staff access to a few clients while they're learning. Add more as they get up to speed.

**Use tags for assignments.** If you have 50 clients and hire a new bookkeeper, tagging clients by type makes assignments automatic.

**Review activity regularly.** Spot errors early by checking what team members are doing, especially for new hires.

**Don't share logins.** Each person should have their own account. Shared logins break audit trails and create security risks.

<Warning>
Removing a team member is immediate. Make sure to transfer their clients first, or those clients will have no assigned staff.
