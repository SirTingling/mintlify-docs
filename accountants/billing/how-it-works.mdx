## Failed payments

If a payment fails:

4. After 3 failed attempts, account access is restricted

<Warning>

3. Confirm cancellation

After cancellation:

## Billing your clients

Pluvel doesn't require you to use any specific billing model for your clients. Common approaches:

| Model | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Monthly retainer | $500/month flat fee |
| Per transaction | $0.50 per transaction |
| Revenue-based | 1% of monthly revenue |
| Hourly | Track time and bill hours |
| Value-based | Custom pricing per engagement |

### Collecting payments

Options for collecting from clients:

**External billing:**
- Use your own invoicing software
- Bill clients directly
- Pluvel isn't involved in client payments

**Through Pluvel:**
- Set up client billing in Pluvel
- We charge clients and pay you
