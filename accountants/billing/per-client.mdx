Optionally use Pluvel to bill your clients directly. We handle invoicing and payment collection, then pay you.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up billing for a client">
    Go to **Client → Settings → Billing** and configure their fee.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Client adds payment method">
    Client enters their credit card or bank account in their portal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="We charge them monthly">
    On their billing date, we charge the configured amount.
  </Step>

  <Step title="We pay you">
    Collected amounts are deposited to your bank account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting client fees

For each client, configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Monthly fee | Fixed amount charged monthly |
| Billing day | Day of month to charge (1-28) |
| Start date | When billing should begin |
| Payment method | Card or bank account required |

### Variable billing

For non-fixed fees:

1. Enable **Variable Billing**
2. Each month, set the amount before billing day
3. Or connect to time tracking for automatic calculation

## Fee structures

Support for multiple fee types:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Flat monthly | $500/month |
| Flat + variable | $300 base + hourly overage |
| Percentage | 1% of revenue (set manually or connect data) |
| Transaction-based | $X per transaction (calculated automatically) |

## Payment methods

Clients can pay via:

- **Credit card** — Visa, Mastercard, American Express
- **ACH bank transfer** — Lower fees, longer processing

### Payment method on file

Clients enter their payment method in:
- Their portal → Settings → Payment Method
- Or you can enter it for them (with their permission)

## Collecting payments

### Automatic charging

With a payment method on file:
- We charge on the billing day
- Client receives a receipt
- You receive a payment notification

### Manual invoicing

Prefer to send invoices instead?
1. Disable auto-billing for the client
2. Create invoices manually in **Client → Invoices**
3. Send to client
4. They pay online

## Payouts to you

Collected payments are deposited to your bank:

| Payout frequency | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Daily | Payments deposited next business day |
| Weekly | All payments deposited on Friday |
| Monthly | All payments deposited on 1st |

Set your preference in **Firm Settings → Billing → Payouts**.

### Payout details

Each payout shows:
- Client breakdown
- Gross collected
- Processing fees
- Net deposited

## Processing fees

Fees are deducted from client payments:

| Method | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| Credit card | 2.9% + $0.30 |
| ACH | 0.8% (max $5) |

Example: $500 charge via credit card
- Gross: $500.00
- Fee: $14.80
- Net to you: $485.20

<Tip>
Encourage clients to use ACH for lower fees on larger payments.
</Tip>

## Failed payments

When a client payment fails:

1. We retry after 3 days
2. Client receives notification
3. You receive an alert
4. After 3 failures, marked as failed

### Handling failures

Options:
- Contact client to update payment method
- Manually create invoice for the amount
- Pause service until paid

## Billing portal

Clients can manage their billing:

- View invoices and payment history
- Update payment method
- Download receipts
- See upcoming charges

Access via their portal → Settings → Billing.

## Reporting

Track client billing:

- **Revenue by client** — What each client pays
- **Collection rate** — Successful vs. failed payments
- **Outstanding** — Unpaid invoices
- **Trends** — Revenue over time

View in **Firm Dashboard → Billing → Reports**.
