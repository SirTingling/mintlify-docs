You just signed a new client. They're excited, you're excited — and now you need to actually get their financials into Pluvel so you can start working. The faster you onboard them, the faster you're billing for real work instead of setup busywork.

Here's how to bring a client into your firm — whether they're brand new to Pluvel or already have an account.

## Two ways to add clients

### Option 1: Invite an existing business

If your client already has a business (with or without a Pluvel account):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Clients">
    From your firm dashboard, click **Clients → Add Client**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Invite Existing">
    Select "Invite an existing business."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter client details">
    Add:
    - Client's business name
    - Primary contact email
    - Contact name
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set permissions">
    Choose what access level the client will have to their own data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send invitation">
    Click **Send Invitation**. The client receives an email to connect their business.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: Create a new company for them

If you're setting up a new client from scratch:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Clients">
    From your firm dashboard, click **Clients → Add Client**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Create New">
    Select "Create a new company."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter company details">
    Add:
    - Company name
    - Entity type (LLC, Corp, etc.)
    - State of formation
    - Business address
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add client contact">
    Enter the client's email so they can access their portal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete setup">
    The company is created and added to your client list.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What clients see

When a client joins your firm:

| They can see | They cannot see |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Their own financial data | Other clients' data |
| Documents you share | Your internal notes |
| Invoices and payments | Your firm billing |
| Reports and statements | Your team activity |

## Client permissions

Control what your clients can do:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Full access** | Client can view and edit everything |
| **View only** | Client can view but not modify |
| **Limited** | Client sees only what you share |
| **No access** | You manage everything; client uses portal only |

Most firms use **Limited** or **View only** for clients who want oversight without day-to-day involvement.

## Initial client setup

After adding a client, complete their setup:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect bank accounts">
    Connect their bank accounts via Plaid or have them authorize the connection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up chart of accounts">
    Import their existing chart of accounts or set up a standard one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import historical data">
    Migrate data from QuickBooks, Xero, or other systems.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure integrations">
    Connect Stripe, Shopify, payroll, and other tools they use.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set preferences">
    Configure their fiscal year, reporting preferences, and notifications.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Client onboarding checklist

We provide an onboarding checklist for each new client:

- [ ] Bank accounts connected
- [ ] Chart of accounts configured
- [ ] Historical data imported
- [ ] Integrations connected
- [ ] Team members assigned
- [ ] Client portal access sent
- [ ] Initial reconciliation completed

Track progress in **Client → Settings → Onboarding**.

## Assigning team members

Assign your staff to work on specific clients:

1. Go to the client's settings
2. Click **Team Access**
3. Select team members and their roles
4. Save changes

<Info>
Team members only see clients they're assigned to. Firm Admins can see all clients.
</Info>

## Client limits

Your firm plan determines how many clients you can manage:

| Plan | Client limit |
|------|--------------|
| Firm Starter | 5 clients |
| Firm Growth | 25 clients |
| Firm Scale | Unlimited |

## Removing a client

To remove a client from your firm:

1. Go to **Client → Settings**
2. Click **Remove from Firm**
3. Choose whether to:
   - Transfer ownership back to the client
   - Keep the data but remove access
   - Archive the client

<Warning>
Removing a client revokes your team's access immediately. Make sure to complete any pending work first.
