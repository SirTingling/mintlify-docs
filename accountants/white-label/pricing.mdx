## Billing your clients

White-label lets you set your own pricing for clients. Common models:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Monthly retainer | Fixed monthly fee per client |
| Transaction volume | Based on number of transactions |
| Revenue percentage | Percentage of client revenue |
| À la carte | Separate fees for each service |

Pluvel doesn't require you to use any specific model. Bill clients however you prefer.

### Billing through Pluvel

Optionally, use Pluvel to bill your clients:

1. Go to **Firm Settings → Billing → Client Billing**
2. Set up billing per client
3. We charge them and deposit to you (minus payment fees)

See [Firm Billing](/accountants/billing/how-it-works) for details.

## No per-client fees

Unlike some platforms, Pluvel doesn't charge you per client. Your firm plan is a flat monthly fee regardless of client activity.

| Scenario | Your cost |
|----------|-----------|
| 5 active clients | $399/month (Firm Growth) |
| 25 active clients | $399/month (Firm Growth) |
| 50 active clients | $799/month (Firm Scale) |
| 100 active clients | $799/month (Firm Scale) |

## Add-ons

Additional services available for purchase:

| Add-on | Price | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Additional domains | $50/month each | Multiple white-label domains |
| Custom development | Quote | Custom features for your firm |
| Onboarding assistance | $500 one-time | Help migrating clients |
| Training sessions | $200/hour | Training for your team |

## Upgrading plans

Upgrade anytime:

1. Go to **Firm Settings → Billing → Plan**
2. Select new plan
3. Confirm upgrade
4. New features available immediately

Upgrades are prorated. You're only charged the difference for the remaining billing period.

## Downgrading

To downgrade:

1. Reduce clients below the new plan's limit
2. Go to **Firm Settings → Billing → Plan**
3. Select lower plan
4. Confirm downgrade

Downgrades take effect at the next billing cycle.

<Warning>
If you downgrade from a plan with white-labeling, your custom domain stops working. Clients will be redirected to the standard Pluvel URL.
</Warning>

| Plan | Monthly | Annual (save 2 months) |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| Firm Starter | $199/month | $1,990/year |
