description: Offer Pluvel to your clients under your brand.
---

Your clients log into "app.pluvel.com" and see Pluvel's logo. That's fine — but it doesn't exactly reinforce that *you* are their accountant. They're using *your* service, powered by software they've never heard of.

White-labeling flips this. Clients log into "books.yourfirm.com" and see your logo, your colors, your brand. They get emails from your domain. As far as they know, this is your platform. It is — you just didn't have to build it.

## What white-labeling includes

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Your logo | Replace Pluvel branding with yours |
| Your colors | Match your brand colors |
| Custom domain | books.yourfirm.com instead of pluvel.com |
| Email sender | Notifications come from your domain |
| Client portal | Clients see your brand, not Pluvel |
| Login page | Branded sign-in experience |
| Mobile app | Coming soon — branded mobile experience |

## What clients see

With white-labeling:

**Before (standard):**
- Clients log in to app.pluvel.com
- See Pluvel logo and branding
- Receive emails from Pluvel

**After (white-label):**
- Clients log in to books.yourfirm.com
- See your logo and brand colors
- Receive emails from yourfirm.com

Clients never know they're using Pluvel unless you tell them.

## Requirements

To enable white-labeling, you need:

- Firm Growth or Firm Scale plan
- A domain you control (for custom subdomain)
- Your logo files (light and dark versions)
- Brand colors (primary, secondary)

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upgrade to eligible plan">
    White-labeling requires Firm Growth ($399/month) or Firm Scale ($799/month).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your brand">
    Upload your logo and set brand colors in Firm Settings → White Label.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up custom domain">
    Add a CNAME record pointing your subdomain to Pluvel. We handle SSL.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure email">
    Set up SPF/DKIM records so emails come from your domain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go live">
    Your clients now access a fully branded experience.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Brand vs. white-label

| Feature | Standard | White-label |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Your logo in portal | ✓ | ✓ |
| Your colors | ✓ | ✓ |
| Custom domain | ✗ | ✓ |
| Branded emails | ✗ | ✓ |
| No Pluvel mentions | ✗ | ✓ |
| Custom login page | ✗ | ✓ |

Even without full white-labeling, you can add your logo and colors on any plan.

## Pricing

White-labeling is included in:

| Plan | White-label included |
|------|---------------------|
| Firm Starter | ✗ (branding only) |
| Firm Growth | ✓ |
| Firm Scale | ✓ |

No additional per-client fees for white-labeling.

## What stays Pluvel-branded

Some things can't be white-labeled:

- Pluvel's support documentation (this site)
- Direct support tickets (handled by Pluvel)
- Legal documents (Terms of Service reference Pluvel)

However, you can create your own help documentation and be the first line of support for your clients.
