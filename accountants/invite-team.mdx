Right now, you're the only one who can access client accounts. If you're sick, on vacation, or just swamped — nobody else can step in. That's a bottleneck you don't need.

Add your team to the firm account. Each person gets their own login with appropriate access levels — bookkeepers see transactions, senior staff can make entries, admins manage settings. You stay in control while spreading the work.

## Team member roles

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| **Firm Admin** | Full access to all clients and firm settings |
| **Senior Accountant** | Full access to assigned clients, can't modify firm settings |
| **Bookkeeper** | Transaction access to assigned clients |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to assigned clients |
