When you're managing books for multiple clients, you need efficiency. Bookkeeper Tools are batch operations and shortcuts designed for professionals who do this all day.

## Batch Categorization

Categorize multiple transactions at once:

1. Go to a client's **Transactions** view
2. Select multiple transactions (checkbox or shift-click)
3. Click **Categorize**
4. Choose the category
5. Apply

Done. 50 transactions categorized in seconds.

You can also split the selection — some go to one category, some to another. The batch tool handles it.

<Info>
Batch categorization applies the same category and rules to all selected transactions. For transactions that need different treatment, categorize individually.

## Bank Rules (Bulk Create)

Instead of setting up rules one at a time:

1. Go to **Accounting → Bank Rules**
2. Click **Bulk Create**
3. Upload a CSV with vendor patterns and categories
4. Preview and confirm

Common use case: Client has consistent vendors you've categorized before. Export the patterns, upload them as rules, and future transactions auto-categorize.

## Multi-Client Reports

Generate the same report across multiple clients:

1. Go to **Reports** in Firm Mode
2. Select the report type (P&L, Balance Sheet, etc.)
3. Check the clients you want
4. Choose date range
5. Generate

You get a combined PDF with each client's report as a section. Good for batch deliveries.

## Transaction Review Queue

See uncategorized or flagged transactions across all clients:

1. Go to **Dashboard → Review Queue**
2. Filter by client or leave it as "all"
3. Work through the list

The queue surfaces items that need attention:
- Uncategorized transactions
- Duplicate candidates
- Unusual amounts flagged by AI
- Client-marked "needs review"

Clear your queue regularly to keep books clean.

## Quick Switch

Jump between clients without navigating:

- **Keyboard shortcut:** Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows)
- Type the client name
- Hit Enter

You're in that client's account instantly. Works from anywhere in Pluvel.

## Reconciliation Status Dashboard

See reconciliation status across all clients:

| Column | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| Client | Client name |
| Accounts | Number of bank accounts |
| Last Reconciled | When accounts were last reconciled |
| Unreconciled | Transactions since last reconciliation |
| Status | On track, behind, attention needed |

Find this in **Dashboard → Reconciliation Status**.

Click any client to jump directly to their reconciliation view.

## Memo and Notes

Add internal notes that clients don't see:

**Transaction memo:** Right-click any transaction → Add Memo. These are internal notes about the transaction.

**Client notes:** In the client profile, add notes about their setup, preferences, or issues.

**Journal entry notes:** Explain adjusting entries for future reference.

Notes are searchable. Useful when you need to remember why you did something 6 months ago.

## Task Templates

For repeating workflows:

1. Go to **Firm Settings → Task Templates**
2. Create a template ("Monthly Close Tasks")
3. Add the steps:
   - Reconcile bank accounts
   - Review uncategorized transactions
   - Generate draft P&L
   - Send to client for review
4. Save

When you start month-end for a client, apply the template. All tasks get created automatically.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Speed up common actions:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + K` | Quick client switch |
| `C` | Categorize selected transaction |
| `R` | Mark as reviewed |
| `D` | Mark as duplicate |
| `M` | Add memo |
| `J` | Jump to journal entries |
| `Esc` | Close modals |

See all shortcuts in **Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts** or press `?` from anywhere.

## Split Transactions

For transactions that need multiple categories:

1. Click the transaction
2. Click **Split**
3. Add line items with different categories
4. Amounts must total the original transaction
5. Save

Example: A $500 Costco purchase — $300 to Supplies, $200 to Meals.

## Duplicate Detection

Pluvel flags potential duplicates:

- Same vendor, same amount, same date
- Similar amounts within a few days
- Common patterns from bank/card overlap

Review flagged duplicates in the Review Queue. Confirm true duplicates or dismiss false positives.

## Exporting Work

Export your work for records or client delivery:

- **Transaction list:** CSV or Excel with all transactions and categories
- **Journal entries:** All entries for a period
- **Trial balance:** At any date
- **Workpapers:** Reconciliation documentation

Find exports in each section's "Export" menu or in **Reports → Export**.

## Tips

**Use the queue.** The Review Queue is your home base. Process it daily and you'll never have a backlog.

**Build rules aggressively.** Every recurring vendor should have a rule. Future-you will thank past-you.

**Templates for consistency.** Task templates ensure you don't miss steps, especially for month-end or year-end procedures.

**Learn the shortcuts.** Five minutes learning shortcuts saves hours over time.
