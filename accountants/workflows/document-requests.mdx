## Client experience

When you send a request, clients:

1. Receive an email notification
2. Click the link to access their portal
3. See exactly what's needed
4. Upload files directly
5. Mark items as submitted

They don't need to log in — the link is secure and specific to this request.

## Tracking requests

Monitor all outstanding requests:

### Request status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Sent | Request sent, waiting for client |
| Viewed | Client has opened the request |
| Partial | Some items uploaded |
| Complete | All items received |
| Overdue | Past due date, still incomplete |

### Request dashboard

View all requests across clients:

1. Go to **Firm Dashboard → Document Requests**
2. Filter by status, client, or due date
3. See what's outstanding

## Reminders

### Automatic reminders

Enable auto-reminders in request settings:

1. Set "Send reminder every X days"
2. Set "Stop after X reminders"
3. Reminders include the request link

### Manual reminders

Send a one-time reminder:

1. Open the request
2. Click **Send Reminder**
3. Add a personal note if desired

## Following up

When requests go unanswered:

1. **First reminder** — Automatic (if enabled) or send manually
2. **Second reminder** — Add context ("I need this for your monthly close")
3. **Phone call** — Sometimes a quick call is more effective
4. **Escalate** — Contact a different person at the client if available

<Tip>
Mark requests as high priority to surface them in the client's portal.
</Tip>

## Receiving documents

When clients upload:

1. You receive a notification
2. Documents appear in the request
3. Review each document
4. Mark as accepted or request revision

### Requesting revisions

If a document doesn't meet requirements:

1. Open the uploaded file
2. Click **Request Revision**
3. Explain what's wrong
4. Client receives notification to fix it

## Document storage

Uploaded documents are stored with the client:

- Organized by request
- Searchable by name and date
- Retained according to your firm's policy

Access in **Client → Documents → All Documents**.

## Bulk requests

Request documents from multiple clients:

1. Go to **Firm Dashboard → Document Requests**
2. Click **Bulk Request**
3. Select clients
4. Choose document type
5. Set due date
6. Send to all

Useful for recurring requests like monthly statements or year-end tax documents.

## Integration with workflows

Document requests connect to other workflows:

- **Transaction review** — Request receipt for unverified transaction
- **Month-end** — Request missing documents before close
- **Tax prep** — Request tax documents for return preparation
