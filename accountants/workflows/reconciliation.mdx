Reconciliation is how you prove the books match reality. The bank says $47,832.16. Your books say $47,832.16. Everything ties. Client is happy. Auditor is happy. You're happy.

When they don't match, you've got work to do.

## How reconciliation works in Pluvel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter the statement balance">
    Pull the ending balance from the bank statement. This is your target number.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pluvel compares everything">
    Transactions in your books get compared against what the bank shows. Matches are marked automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clear what matches">
    Matched transactions get a checkmark. Cleared means "yes, the bank agrees this happened."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Investigate what doesn't">
    Unmatched items need your attention. Something's in your books that isn't at the bank, or vice versa.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Zero it out">
    When your adjusted book balance equals the statement balance, you're reconciled. Lock it and move on.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Starting a reconciliation

1. Open the client
2. Go to **Banking → Reconciliation**
3. Select which account (checking, savings, credit card)
4. Enter statement ending date
5. Enter statement ending balance
6. Click **Start Reconciliation**

You'll see a list of transactions and a running difference at the top. Your job: get that difference to $0.00.

## The reconciliation screen

| Section | What you're looking at |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Statement balance** | The number from the bank statement |
| **Book balance** | What your records say as of that date |
| **Cleared balance** | Sum of transactions you've marked as cleared |
| **Difference** | What's left to figure out — your target is $0.00 |
| **Transaction list** | Individual items to clear or investigate |

## Clearing transactions

### Auto-matching

Pluvel automatically clears transactions when:
- Exact amount and date match
- Amount matches with date within a few days
- Same recurring transaction you've matched before

These show green checkmarks. They're done.

### Manual clearing

For items that didn't auto-match:

1. Find the transaction in the list
2. Check the box next to it
3. Watch the difference update

If a transaction clears at the bank but shows a different date in your books, that's fine. Clear it anyway. Minor date discrepancies are normal.

### Bulk clearing

Got 50 small transactions that all match? Select them all and clear in one click. Don't process them individually.

## When things don't match

### Transaction in your books, not at the bank

Common reasons:
- **Timing** — Check written but not cashed yet. Leave it uncleared.
- **Error** — You recorded something that didn't happen. Delete or void it.
- **Duplicate** — Same thing entered twice. Mark one as duplicate.

For timing differences, don't stress. They'll clear next month when the check gets cashed.

### Transaction at the bank, not in your books

You're missing something:
- **Bank fee** — Add an expense for "Bank Service Fees"
- **Interest** — Add income for "Interest Earned"
- **Client spent money you don't know about** — Send them a question

Click **Add Transaction** directly from the reconciliation screen to create missing entries without losing your place.

### Amount differences

Same transaction, different amounts. Research which is right:
- Check the actual receipt or invoice
- Ask the client what it was supposed to be
- Look for transposition errors ($85 vs $58)

Fix the amount in your books to match reality.

## Reconciliation adjustments

Sometimes you end up with a small difference that you can't track down:

| Difference | What to do |
|------------|-----------|
| **Under $1.00** | Write off to "Bank Adjustments" — not worth more research time |
| **$1-10** | Spend 5 minutes looking. If you can't find it, adjust. |
| **Over $10** | Keep digging. Something's wrong. |

To make an adjustment:
1. Click **Add Adjustment**
2. Enter amount and category (usually "Bank Adjustments" or "Reconciliation Differences")
3. Add a note explaining what you tried
4. The adjustment closes the gap

These should be rare. If you're adjusting every reconciliation, there's a systemic problem.

## Completing the reconciliation

When difference shows $0.00:

1. Click **Complete Reconciliation**
2. Add any notes for the record
3. Confirm

What happens:
- All cleared transactions are locked
- The reconciliation is recorded with timestamp and your name
- Those transactions can't be edited without unreconciling

## Reconciliation history

View past reconciliations in **Banking → Reconciliation → History**.

Each one shows:
- Statement date and balance
- How many transactions were cleared
- Any adjustments made
- Who completed it
- When

This is your audit trail. When a client asks "was January reconciled?" you can point to the record.

## Unreconciling (when you must)

Found an error after completing? You can undo:

1. Go to reconciliation history
2. Click the reconciliation you need to fix
3. Click **Unreconcile**

<Warning>
This reopens all transactions from that period. They can be edited again. Only do this if you have a real error — not just to tweak something minor.
</Warning>

## Multi-account tracking

For clients with several accounts, track status in one place:

| Account | Last reconciled | Status |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Operating Checking | Jan 31 | ✓ Current |
| Savings | Jan 31 | ✓ Current |
| Credit Card | Dec 31 | ⚠️ Behind |
| Payroll Account | Jan 31 | ✓ Current |

The yellow warning means you're a month behind. Catch up before it becomes two months.

View this in **Banking → Reconciliation → Overview** or on the firm dashboard for all clients.

## Best practices from people who do this all day

**Reconcile monthly, religiously.** Two months behind is twice as hard. Three months is a nightmare.

**Use statement dates.** Reconcile to the actual statement ending date, not today's date.

**Document adjustments.** When you make an adjustment, note what you tried before giving up.

**Watch for patterns.** If the same type of discrepancy keeps appearing, fix the root cause.

**Clear the prior month first.** Don't start February's reconciliation until January is complete.
