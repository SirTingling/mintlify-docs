You've got 200 uncategorized transactions waiting across 8 clients. You could spend your entire afternoon clicking through them one at a time. Or you could work smart.

Transaction review is where bookkeepers spend most of their time. Pluvel's workflow is built to make that time count.

## The review queue

Instead of hunting through each client separately, see everything in one place:

**From the firm dashboard:**
1. Click **Tasks → Transaction Review**
2. See which clients have pending items
3. Click a client to start reviewing

**From inside a client:**
1. Go to **Banking → Transactions**
2. Filter to "Needs Review"
3. Work through the list

The firm-level view is better for batch work. The client-level view is better when you're focused on one client.

## The review interface

When you're reviewing transactions, you see:

| Panel | What it shows |
|-------|--------------|
| **Transaction list** | Everything needing review, sorted by date |
| **Transaction detail** | Full info on the selected transaction |
| **Category selector** | Account dropdown with search |
| **Similar transactions** | Same vendor or amount — helps spot patterns |
| **History** | How you've categorized this vendor before |

That history panel is the time-saver. "Last time I saw a charge from ADOBE, I put it in Software Subscriptions." Accept it in one click.

## Categorizing efficiently

### Single transactions

The slow way:
1. Click transaction
2. Click dropdown
3. Scroll through 80 accounts
4. Find the right one
5. Click Save

The fast way:
1. Click transaction
2. Type "soft" (for Software Subscriptions)
3. Hit Enter

Three seconds. Next transaction.

### Bulk categorization

Twelve transactions from the same coffee shop:

1. Select all 12 (Shift+Click or check boxes)
2. Click **Categorize**
3. Pick the account
4. **Categorize All**

Done. 12 transactions in 5 seconds.

### Accepting suggestions

Pluvel suggests categories based on vendor names, similar transactions, and patterns it's learned from your categorization history.

Suggestions show confidence levels:
- **High confidence** (green) — Probably right. Accept unless something seems off.
- **Medium confidence** (yellow) — Possible match. Worth checking.
- **No suggestion** — Pluvel has no idea. You're on your own.

For high-confidence suggestions, just hit Enter. Don't overthink it.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Stop clicking. Learn these:

| Shortcut | What it does |
|----------|--------------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Move between transactions |
| `Enter` | Accept suggestion or save |
| `Tab` | Jump to account field |
| `/` | Search accounts |
| `R` | Mark as reviewed |
| `D` | Mark as duplicate |
| `S` | Split transaction |
| `?` | Send to client with a question |

A skilled bookkeeper with keyboard shortcuts can process 100 transactions in 15 minutes. Clicking through the same 100 takes an hour.

## Creating bank rules

If you're categorizing the same vendor for the third time, stop. Create a rule.

1. Categorize the transaction
2. Click **Create Rule**
3. Set conditions:
   - "Vendor contains DROPBOX"
   - "Amount is between $10 and $15"
4. Set the action: "Assign to Software Subscriptions"
5. Save

Next month, that Dropbox charge categorizes itself. You never touch it again.

### Managing rules

Each client has their own rules in **Client → Settings → Bank Rules**.

You can:
- See all active rules
- Check which rules are firing most often
- Disable rules that aren't working
- Set priority (when multiple rules match, which wins?)

Good rule hygiene saves hours per month per client. It compounds.

## Handling the weird stuff

### Unknown vendors

Transaction says "STRIPE TRANSFER 847261" — no idea what it is.

1. Click **Ask Client**
2. Type your question: "What's this $347 Stripe transfer for?"
3. Send

The client gets a notification. Their answer appears right on the transaction. You don't need to email back and forth.

### Duplicates

Same transaction imported twice (common when clients use multiple bank feeds):

1. Click **Mark as Duplicate**
2. Select which one is the original
3. The duplicate disappears from reports

Don't delete it — mark it as duplicate. The audit trail matters.

### Splits

One transaction, multiple categories:
- $500 Costco run = $350 office supplies + $150 break room snacks

1. Click **Split**
2. Add lines with amounts and categories
3. Make sure they sum to the original
4. Save

Reports show the real breakdown, not a misleading lump.

## Review workflow

Here's how efficient bookkeepers attack transaction review:

1. **Start at the firm dashboard.** See which clients have the biggest backlogs.
2. **Pick the worst one.** Get it to zero before moving on.
3. **Filter to Needs Review.** Don't look at already-categorized items.
4. **Sort by vendor.** Group similar transactions together.
5. **Bulk categorize obvious patterns.** 15 coffee shop charges? One action.
6. **Accept high-confidence suggestions.** Don't second-guess the obvious ones.
7. **Create rules as you go.** Third time seeing the same vendor? Make a rule.
8. **Send questions to clients immediately.** Don't let unknown items pile up.
9. **Mark complete and move to next client.**

## Tracking your progress

The firm dashboard shows:
- **Transactions reviewed** per period
- **Average time per transaction**
- **Rule hit rate** (% auto-categorized)
- **Exception rate** (% requiring client input)

Watch your rule hit rate. It should climb over time. If you're manually categorizing the same things month after month, you're working too hard.
