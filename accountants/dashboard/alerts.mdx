Client B's bank connection broke three days ago. You didn't notice because you were busy with other clients. Now their transactions are stale and you're behind on reconciliation.

Alerts prevent this. Problems across all your clients — disconnected banks, overdue filings, unusual transactions — surface in one place. Red means urgent. Yellow means soon. You see what needs attention before it becomes a crisis.
