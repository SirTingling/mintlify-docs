When you're managing 10, 50, or 100 clients, deadlines pile up fast. The Firm Calendar puts everything in one view — compliance deadlines, filing due dates, client tasks, and team schedules.

## The Calendar View

Go to **Dashboard → Calendar** in Firm Mode.

You'll see deadlines and tasks across all your clients:

- **Red** — Past due or due today
- **Orange** — Due within 7 days
- **Blue** — Upcoming (7+ days)
- **Gray** — Completed

Click any item to see details, jump to the client, or mark it done.

## What's on the Calendar

| Item Type | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| Compliance deadlines | Annual reports, BOI filings, license renewals |
| Tax deadlines | 941s, state filings, estimated taxes |
| Client tasks | Items you've created for specific clients |
| Internal tasks | Firm-level tasks (not client-specific) |
| Payroll dates | When payroll needs to be submitted |
| Review reminders | Month-end close, reconciliation tasks |

Everything syncs automatically. If Pluvel knows about a deadline, it shows up here.

## Filtering the Calendar

With many clients, you need filters:

**By client:** Show only deadlines for one client or a subset.

**By type:** Only compliance deadlines, or only tasks, etc.

**By assignee:** What's assigned to me? What's assigned to Sarah?

**By status:** Hide completed items, or show everything.

Filter controls are above the calendar. Combine filters to narrow down.

## Calendar Views

**Month view** — See the full month at a glance. Good for planning and spotting busy periods.

**Week view** — More detail. See each day's items clearly.

**List view** — No calendar, just a chronological list. Good for working through items one by one.

**Agenda view** — Today + next 14 days. What needs attention now?

Switch views with the toggle in the top right.

## Creating Tasks and Deadlines

Add items directly from the calendar:

1. Click a date
2. Choose **Task** or **Deadline**
3. Enter details (description, client, assignee, due date)
4. Save

Or create from a client's account, and it appears on the calendar automatically.

## Recurring Items

For things that repeat:

- **Monthly reconciliation** — Due on the 15th every month
- **Quarterly 941s** — April 30, July 31, Oct 31, Jan 31
- **Annual reports** — Due dates vary by state

Set up recurrence when creating the item. Pluvel creates future instances automatically.

<Info>
Compliance deadlines are pre-populated based on your client's state and entity type. You don't have to set these up manually.

## Team Scheduling

If you have staff:

- See each person's workload by filtering to their assignments
- Balance work by reassigning items
- Track who's overloaded and who has capacity

Calendar density is a quick visual indicator of team workload.

## External Calendar Sync

Connect to Google Calendar, Outlook, or iCal:

1. Go to **Firm Settings → Integrations → Calendar**
2. Choose your calendar service
3. Authorize the connection
4. Select what to sync (deadlines, tasks, or both)

Items appear in your external calendar. Changes sync both ways.

## Notifications from Calendar Items

Each calendar item can trigger notifications:

- **7 days before** — Early warning
- **1 day before** — Final reminder
- **Day of** — It's due today
- **Past due** — You missed it

Configure defaults in **Firm Settings → Notifications → Calendar**. Override per-item if needed.

## Conflict Detection

If you assign too many items to one day:

- Visual warning (day turns red)
- Summary: "12 items due on April 15"
- Suggestion to spread work out

This helps avoid crunch periods where everything lands on the same day.

## Exporting and Sharing

**Export:** Download the calendar as ICS (for personal calendars) or CSV (for spreadsheets).

**Share:** Generate a read-only link for clients or team members who don't have Pluvel access.

**Print:** Generate a printable monthly view for your wall or client meetings.

Find these in **Calendar → Export**.

## Tips

**Check the calendar weekly.** Spend 10 minutes every Monday reviewing the next two weeks. No surprises.

**Use list view for catching up.** Knocked out a bunch of tasks? List view makes it easy to mark them all done.

**Color-code by client or type.** If you have many clients, color coding helps you scan quickly.

**Don't ignore the orange.** Items due within 7 days need attention. Don't wait until they're red.
