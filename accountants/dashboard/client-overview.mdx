Twenty clients. Some need attention. Some are fine. A few have deadlines this week. How do you know where to focus?

The client overview is your morning check-in. Scan it in 30 seconds, know what's on fire, prioritize your day.

## The overview grid

Every client in one view:

| Column | What you see |
|--------|--------------|
| **Client name** | Company name — click to open their account |
| **Status** | Color-coded health indicator |
| **Cash** | Current cash position |
| **AR** | Outstanding receivables |
| **AP** | Outstanding payables |
| **Last activity** | When you or your team last worked on them |
| **Alerts** | Number of issues needing attention |

Sort by any column. Click a row to dive in.

## Status indicators

The status column tells you where to look:

| Color | Meaning | Typical causes |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 🟢 **Green** | All good | Reconciled, no overdue items, no alerts |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | Needs attention | Minor issues — transactions behind, deadline approaching |
| 🔴 **Red** | Urgent | Critical issues — overdue filings, broken bank connection, negative cash |

Status is calculated automatically from:
- Unreconciled transactions (30+ days behind = yellow, 60+ = red)
- Overdue compliance deadlines
- Pending document requests past due date
- Negative cash balance
- Unresolved alerts

You don't set the status. Pluvel does, based on what's actually happening.

## Filtering your view

### Quick filters

| Filter | What you see |
|--------|--------------|
| **All clients** | Everyone |
| **Needs attention** | Yellow and red only — your priority list |
| **By team member** | Clients assigned to specific staff |
| **By industry** | Group by business type |
| **Active only** | Hide archived/inactive clients |

The "Needs attention" filter is where you start your day. Work through that list first.

### Sorting options

Click any column header to sort:
- Client name (alphabetical)
- Status (worst first — red, yellow, green)
- Cash position (highest or lowest)
- Last activity (recently touched or neglected)
- Alert count (most urgent first)

"Status: worst first" + "Last activity: oldest" shows you clients who are in trouble and haven't been touched in a while. That's your priority queue.

## Client quick actions

Click a client row to expand quick actions without fully opening their account:

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Open** | Go to their full dashboard |
| **Transactions** | Jump straight to uncategorized items |
| **Reconcile** | Start bank reconciliation |
| **Reports** | Generate P&L, balance sheet |
| **Message** | Send a message |

For quick tasks — checking transaction count, running a report — you can do it from here without navigating away.

## Aggregate metrics

The header shows totals across your entire book:

| Metric | What it shows |
|--------|--------------|
| **Total clients** | Active client count |
| **Total AUM** | Sum of all client assets — what you're managing |
| **Pending items** | Uncategorized transactions across everyone |
| **Overdue tasks** | Work items past due date |
| **Upcoming deadlines** | Compliance due in next 30 days |

When "Pending items" creeps up, you're falling behind on transaction review. When "Overdue tasks" increases, your to-do list is getting away from you.

## Search

3. Drag to reorder
4. Columns save for your account

2. Click **Save View**
3. Name it: "Month-end review" or "High-touch clients"
4. Access saved views from the dropdown

- **My clients** — Filtered to clients assigned to you

| **Export list** | Get a CSV of selected clients |
| **Reassign** | Move clients to a different team member |

</Info>

## Keyboard shortcuts

Navigate without touching the mouse:

| Shortcut | What it does |
|----------|--------------|
| `/` | Focus search |
| `n` | Select next client |
| `p` | Select previous client |
| `Enter` | Open selected client |
| `Esc` | Close expanded card |
| `?` | Show all shortcuts |

## Making the overview work for you

**Check it every morning.** 30 seconds scanning the grid tells you what needs attention today.

**Sort by status + last activity.** Clients in trouble who haven't been touched = highest priority.

**Use filters aggressively.** You don't need to see green clients when you're putting out fires.

**Watch the aggregate metrics.** If "Pending items" keeps growing, you're losing ground. If it's shrinking, you're catching up.

**Set up saved views.** Don't re-configure filters every time. Save them and switch with one click.
