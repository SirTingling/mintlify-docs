Instead of juggling email threads for every client question, use Messages to keep communications in context. Ask about a transaction, request a document, or answer questions — all linked to the client's account.

## The Messages Dashboard

Go to **Dashboard → Messages** in Firm Mode.

You'll see:
- Unread messages across all clients (newest first)
- Messages needing response (no reply in 24+ hours)
- Recent conversations

Click any message to open the full thread with that client.

## Starting a Conversation

From anywhere in a client's account:

1. Click the **Message** icon (or find it in the client profile)
2. Write your message
3. Optionally attach files or link transactions
4. Send

The client gets an email notification with a link to reply. If they have Pluvel login access, they can reply directly in the app.

## Contextual Messages

The real power is linking messages to specific items:

**From a transaction:** "Hey, what was this $450 charge at Office Depot for?" The transaction is attached so the client knows exactly what you're asking about.

**From a document request:** "I need your Q3 bank statement." The request is tracked until they upload it.

**From a task:** "Can you verify this vendor info?" Linked to the task you're working on.

Clients see the context without you having to screenshot or explain.

## Message Notifications

**For you (the accountant):**
- New message badge in the sidebar
- Daily digest of unread messages
- Optional: immediate email for urgent clients

**For clients:**
- Email notification when you send a message
- Email notification for document requests
- Optional: digest vs. immediate (client-configurable)

Configure in **Settings → Notifications → Client Messages**.

## Response Tracking

Track which clients respond and which ghost you:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Sent | You sent a message, waiting for reply |
| Read | Client opened the message |
| Replied | Client responded |
| Needs follow-up | No response in X days |

Filter your message inbox by status to follow up on overdue items.

## Document Requests

A special type of message for requesting files:

1. Click **Request Document**
2. Describe what you need ("Q3 bank statement", "2023 1099s")
3. Set a due date (optional)
4. Send

The client gets a message with an upload button. When they upload, you're notified and the file attaches to their documents.

## Templates

Save time with message templates:

- "Missing information needed for filing"
- "Monthly document request"
- "Year-end checklist"

Create templates in **Settings → Messages → Templates**. Insert client-specific details when you use them.

## Bulk Messages

Need to ask all clients for the same thing?

1. Go to **Messages → New Bulk Message**
2. Select clients (all, or filter by tag/status)
3. Write the message (use merge fields for personalization)
4. Send

Each client gets an individual message. Replies come back to their conversation, not a group thread.

Common use cases:
- "Reminder: Year-end documents due by January 15th"
- "We're closed for the holidays Dec 24-Jan 2"
- "New document portal — here's how to use it"

<Info>
Bulk messages count against your plan's message limits. Check Settings → Billing for your current usage.

## Client Portal vs. Email

Clients can reply two ways:

**In the portal:** If they log into Pluvel, they can reply and upload files directly.

**Via email:** Replies to the notification email thread back to Pluvel and appear in the conversation.

Either way, you see it in one place.

## Message History

Every message is saved:

- Searchable by client, date, or keyword
- Attached to the client's record
- Accessible even if the staff member who sent it leaves

This is your audit trail for client communications.

## Tips

**Don't over-message.** Clients get notification fatigue. Batch requests when possible instead of sending five separate messages.

**Be specific.** "Please send documents" is vague. "Please upload your December bank statement from Chase ending in 4521" is clear.

**Use requests, not just messages.** Document requests are tracked until fulfilled. Regular messages can get lost.

**Check the dashboard weekly.** Unreplied messages pile up. Set aside time to follow up on anything stale.
