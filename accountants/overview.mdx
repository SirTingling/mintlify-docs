description: Manage multiple clients from one dashboard with Firm Mode.
---

You're managing books for 15 clients. Maybe 30. Every month, you're logging into separate accounts, downloading bank feeds, chasing receipts, and trying to remember where you left off with each one.

Firm Mode changes that. One login. All your clients. A dashboard that shows you exactly who needs attention and what's overdue.

## The problem Firm Mode solves

Without it, managing multiple clients looks like this:
- Log into Client A. Download transactions. Categorize 47 items. Log out.
- Log into Client B. Realize their bank connection broke. Try to fix it. Log out.
- Log into Client C. Can't remember if you finished last month's reconciliation. Check. You didn't. Log out.
- Repeat 12 more times.

With Firm Mode:
- Open your dashboard. See all 15 clients at once.
- Client B's bank connection is flagged red. Fix it.
- Client C shows "Reconciliation incomplete" — click and pick up where you left off.
- Switch between clients with one click. Context preserved.

## What you get

**Unified dashboard** — All clients in one view. Who's behind? Who's flagged? Who's waiting on documents? You see it immediately.

**Instant client switching** — Click a name, you're in their books. No logging out. No hunting for credentials. When you switch back, you're right where you left off.

**Aggregate calendar** — Every compliance deadline across every client in one calendar. Annual reports. Payroll taxes. Estimated payments. Nothing falls through the cracks.

**Batch operations** — Run the same report for 10 clients at once. Export P&Ls in bulk. Generate reconciliation status across your whole book.

**White-label option** — Your clients see your brand, not ours. Your logo. Your colors. Your domain. Pluvel becomes invisible.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your firm">
    Create your Pluvel account and enable Firm Mode. Takes about 5 minutes — firm name, billing info, done.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your team">
    Invite staff who'll work on client accounts. Assign roles: admin (full control), bookkeeper (work on clients), or viewer (reports only).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bring in clients">
    Invite existing clients to connect their own accounts, or create accounts on their behalf. Each client gets their own company in Pluvel — completely separate data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Work from one place">
    Use the Firm Dashboard as home base. See who needs attention, what's due, and jump into any client's books instantly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Firm Dashboard

Your command center shows:

| Column | What you see |
|--------|--------------|
| **Client** | Company name and entity type |
| **Status** | Green (good), yellow (needs attention), red (urgent) |
| **Last Activity** | When you or your team last touched this client |
| **Open Items** | Uncategorized transactions, pending reconciliations |
| **Next Deadline** | Nearest compliance or tax deadline |
| **Assigned To** | Which team member owns this client |

Click any row to dive into that client's books. One click, you're there.

## The client switcher

When you're deep in one client's account and need to check something for another, use the client switcher in the top nav.

The clever part: it preserves context. If you were looking at bank reconciliation for Client A, switching to Client B takes you to their bank reconciliation. Not their homepage. Not their dashboard. Exactly where you'd expect to land.

## What your clients see

You control what clients can access:

| Access level | What they can do |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Full access** | Everything except firm settings. Good for engaged clients who want to categorize their own transactions. |
| **View only** | See reports and data, can't change anything. For clients who just want visibility. |
| **Invoice only** | Create and view invoices. Nothing else. |
| **No access** | They don't log in at all. You handle everything. |

Clients never see other clients. Ever. They only see their own company.

## Pricing

Pluvel charges your firm per client per month. How you bill your clients is up to you:

- **Bundle it** — Include Pluvel in your monthly retainer
- **Pass through** — Bill clients separately for the software
- **Mix** — Bundle for some, pass through for others

Volume discounts kick in as you add more clients. See [Billing for firms](/accountants/billing/how-it-works) for the full breakdown.
