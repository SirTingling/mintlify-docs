You could be managing your first client within 10 minutes. Firm setup is quick because we've done this before — we know what you need and what you don't.

## Create your firm account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Go to pluvel.com and create an account with your firm's email. Use your work email, not a personal one — it sets the tone for client communications.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Firm Mode">
    During onboarding, select "I'm an accountant or bookkeeper managing clients."

    This isn't just a label. It unlocks the firm dashboard, multi-client management, bulk operations, and the tools designed for people who do this all day.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your firm's information">
    Enter the basics:
    - Firm name (what clients see)
    - Business address
    - Phone number
    - Website (optional, but helps with white-labeling later)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick a plan">
    Choose based on how many clients you'll manage. Starting small? Pick Starter. You can upgrade anytime without losing data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify and go">
    Confirm your email and you're in. Add your first client whenever you're ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Firm Mode gives you

### Client management
- **Single dashboard** — All clients visible at once
- **One-click switching** — No logging out and back in
- **Cross-client deadlines** — Every compliance date in one calendar
- **Health monitoring** — Know which clients need attention before they call you

### Bookkeeping workflows
- **Transaction review queue** — See uncategorized items across all clients
- **Batch reconciliation** — Work through clients systematically
- **Month-end tracker** — Know where every client stands in the close process
- **Document requests** — Ask clients for what you need, track responses

### Communication
- **In-app messaging** — Everything in one place, not scattered across email
- **Document requests** — With deadlines and automatic reminders
- **Report sharing** — Send financials directly from the app
- **Client activity tracking** — See when they've viewed things

### Billing
- **Client invoicing** — Bill through Pluvel if you want
- **Time tracking** — Optional, if you bill by the hour
- **Payment acceptance** — Clients can pay you directly

## The firm dashboard

Your home base shows everything at a glance:

| Section | What you see |
|---------|--------------|
| **Client overview** | All clients with status indicators and key metrics |
| **Upcoming deadlines** | Tax filings, annual reports, renewals — across all clients |
| **Tasks** | Work items across your book of business |
| **Alerts** | Issues that need your attention now |

This becomes where you start every day. Scan it, know what's on fire, prioritize your work.

## Adding team members

Once your firm is set up, bring in your team:

1. Go to **Firm Settings → Team**
2. Click **Invite Team Member**
3. Enter their email and assign a role:
   - **Admin** — Full firm access, can add clients and manage settings
   - **Bookkeeper** — Work on assigned clients, can't change firm settings
   - **Viewer** — Read-only access to reports
4. They get an invitation email and set up their own login

Each team member can be assigned to specific clients. They only see clients they're assigned to.

## The client portal

Your clients get their own portal where they can:
- See their financial data (what you allow them to see)
- Upload documents you've requested
- Respond to your questions
- View and pay invoices

You control the access level for each client. Some want full visibility; some just want you to handle everything.

## White-labeling

Want Pluvel to disappear behind your brand?

- **Your logo and colors** everywhere clients look
- **Custom domain** (books.yourfirm.com instead of app.pluvel.com)
- **Branded emails** — communications come from you, not us
- **No Pluvel branding** in the interface

Your clients think they're using your proprietary system. They don't need to know what's behind the curtain.
