description: Control what clients can access in their portal.

Some clients want to see everything and make changes themselves. Others just want monthly reports — they hired you so they *don't* have to think about the books. And a few want access to things they probably shouldn't touch.

Permissions let you match access to the relationship. Full control for hands-on clients, view-only for oversight, limited access for those who just need to upload receipts. You decide what each client can see and do.

## Permission levels

| Level | What they can do |
|-------|------------------|
| **Full access** | View and edit everything (like an owner) |
| **Edit access** | Make changes, but can't modify settings |
| **View only** | See everything, can't change anything |
| **Limited** | See only what you explicitly share |
| **Portal only** | Document uploads and messaging only |

## Client users

A client can have multiple users with different permissions:

### Managing client users

You control:
- Who can access the client portal

- Multi-factor authentication requirements

## Sensitive data

Some data requires explicit permission to view:

| Bank balances | Visible to View+ |
| Transaction amounts | Visible to View+ |

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can clients see my notes?">
    No. Internal notes and team comments are never visible to clients unless you explicitly share them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can clients see other clients?">
    Never. Each client only sees their own data. There's no way for clients to access or even know about other clients.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I restrict specific reports?">
    Yes. In feature permissions, expand Reports and choose which specific reports they can access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if a client needs temporary elevated access?">
    You can temporarily upgrade their permissions, then downgrade later. Consider using time-limited access for sensitive situations.
