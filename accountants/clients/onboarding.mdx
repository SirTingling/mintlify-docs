New client just signed. They forward you a zip file of "all their accounting stuff" — 847 files named things like "bank statement.pdf", "bank statement (1).pdf", and "taxes maybe.xlsx".

Their prior accountant is "no longer available." The books haven't been reconciled since March. And they need financials for a loan application next week.

This is client onboarding. Let's do it right.

## The onboarding checklist

Every new client gets a checklist that ensures nothing falls through the cracks. Work through it systematically, and you won't discover missing information six months later.

### Phase 1: Get the information

- [ ] **Business information** — Legal name, EIN, state of formation, entity type
- [ ] **Bank access** — Either Plaid connection or view-only online banking access
- [ ] **Prior financials** — Last 1-2 years of financial statements if they exist
- [ ] **Previous accountant contact** — In case you need historical context
- [ ] **Source documents** — Articles of incorporation, EIN letter, operating agreement

### Phase 2: Set up the system

- [ ] **Create company in Pluvel** — With correct entity type and fiscal year
- [ ] **Connect bank accounts** — Via Plaid or direct integration
- [ ] **Import chart of accounts** — Or start fresh with a template
- [ ] **Set up integrations** — Stripe, Shopify, payroll, whatever they use
- [ ] **Configure payroll** — If you're handling it

### Phase 3: Migrate the data

- [ ] **Import historical transactions** — At least current year, ideally 2-3 years
- [ ] **Enter opening balances** — Starting point for all accounts
- [ ] **Migrate from previous system** — QuickBooks, Xero, Wave, spreadsheets
- [ ] **Verify balances match** — Old system to new system

### Phase 4: Configure settings

- [ ] **Fiscal year and periods** — Calendar year? Different fiscal year?
- [ ] **Tax settings** — Sales tax nexus, withholding states
- [ ] **Compliance tracking** — Annual reports, renewals, registrations
- [ ] **Assign team members** — Who's responsible for this client
- [ ] **Client portal access** — What can they see and do?

### Phase 5: Verify everything

- [ ] **Reconcile all accounts** — Through current
- [ ] **Run trial balance** — Make sure it balances
- [ ] **Generate P&L** — Compare to any prior reports
- [ ] **Document discrepancies** — Note anything that doesn't match

## Using the onboarding tracker

Inside each client:

1. Click **Onboarding** in the sidebar
2. See your checklist with current progress
3. Check off items as you complete them
4. Add notes — "Got EIN letter from client's email on 1/15"

Those notes matter. Six months from now when you wonder where you got a number, the note tells you.

## Document collection

### What to request (and why)

| Document | Why you need it |
|----------|----------------|
| **Bank statements (12+ months)** | Reconciliation and historical context |
| **Prior year tax returns** | Verify classifications, check opening balances |
| **Articles of incorporation** | Confirm entity type, formation date, ownership |
| **EIN letter** | Federal tax ID verification |
| **State registrations** | Know which states require compliance |
| **Insurance certificates** | Document coverage |
| **Major contracts/leases** | Understand commitments and liabilities |

### Getting documents efficiently

Send a structured document request with a deadline:

1. Click **Request Documents**
2. Select the documents you need
3. Set a realistic due date
4. Add context: "I need these to complete your onboarding and start reconciliation"
5. Send

They receive a secure upload link. When they upload, you're notified. No back-and-forth email chains.

## The client intake form

Before you even start setup, get basic information through an intake form:

- Business contact details
- List of bank accounts and credit cards
- Software and tools they use (Stripe, Shopify, payroll provider)
- Known accounting issues or concerns
- Goals and expectations

Customize the form in **Templates → Client Intake Form**.

## Data migration

Most clients are coming from somewhere — QuickBooks, Xero, Wave, or a pile of spreadsheets.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export from the old system">
    Get chart of accounts, customers, vendors, and transactions. Most systems export to CSV. Some have direct API connections.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review before importing">
    Look at what you're bringing in:
    - Duplicate accounts?
    - Inactive items that should stay inactive?
    - Categories that don't make sense?

    Clean it up now. Garbage in, garbage out.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import to Pluvel">
    Use the migration wizard for QuickBooks and Xero — it handles the mapping automatically.

    For CSV imports (Wave, spreadsheets), you'll map columns manually.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the numbers">
    Run trial balance in both systems. They should match.

    If they don't, investigate before moving forward. Don't carry errors into the new system.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the cutover date">
    Pick a date when Pluvel becomes the system of record. Usually the first of a month.

    Before that date: historical data (don't edit).
    After that date: live data (actively managed).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How long does this take?

| Client complexity | Typical onboarding time |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Simple** — Solo business, few transactions, clean records | 1-2 days |
| **Standard** — Small team, moderate volume, organized | 3-5 days |
| **Complex** — Multiple entities, high volume, messy history | 1-2 weeks |

Set expectations upfront. A client with three years of unreconciled books is not getting started this week.

## Common onboarding problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Client won't share bank credentials">
    They don't have to. Send them Plaid's client-initiated flow: they log into their own bank through Plaid's secure window. You never see their password.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prior accountant is MIA">
    Work with what you have. Tax returns and bank statements are usually enough to reconstruct the important stuff. You're not the first to inherit a mess.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Chart of accounts is a disaster">
    Don't import it. Start fresh with a Pluvel template and map old accounts during transaction import. A clean start beats importing 150 accounts when they only need 40.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Years of unreconciled books">
    Prioritize current year — that's what matters for taxes. Reconstruct prior years only as needed, focusing on year-end balances rather than transaction-level accuracy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Client expects instant setup">
    Manage expectations. "I need to import your data, reconcile your accounts, and verify everything. That takes [X] days. I'll keep you updated."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Completing onboarding

When all checklist items are done:

1. Mark onboarding complete in Pluvel
2. Client status changes from "Onboarding" to "Active"
3. Schedule a walkthrough call — show them their dashboard, explain what they can access
4. Set up recurring workflows — monthly close schedule, document request timing

You're now in steady-state mode. The hard part is over.
