"Can you send me your November bank statement?"

You send the email. It disappears into their inbox. A week later, you follow up. Another week, another follow up. Meanwhile, you can't close November because you're waiting on a PDF.

Sound familiar?

Pluvel keeps all client communication in one place — tied directly to their financial data. Requests have deadlines. Reminders are automatic. You can actually see when they've opened your message.

## Messaging clients

### Send a message

1. Open the client
2. Click **Messages** in the sidebar
3. Click **New Message**
4. Type and send

The client gets an email notification with your message. They can reply from the email or log into their portal — either way, the response shows up in Pluvel.

### What you can do in messages

| Feature | Why it matters |
|---------|---------------|
| **Rich text** | Format with bold, bullets, links — not just plain text |
| **Attachments** | Send files up to 25MB |
| **@mentions** | Loop in team members |
| **Transaction links** | Reference a specific transaction: "What was this $347 Stripe charge for?" |
| **Templates** | Don't retype the same request every month |

### Who sees messages

- All team members assigned to this client
- The client (in their portal)

If you need to leave internal notes that clients shouldn't see, use the separate internal notes section — not messages.

## Document requests

This is where Pluvel really shines. Instead of emailing "please send your bank statements" and hoping for the best, create a formal request with a deadline.

### Create a request

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open document requests">
    Go to **Client → Documents → Request**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick what you need">
    Choose from common document types:
    - Bank statements
    - Credit card statements
    - Receipts
    - Contracts
    - Tax forms
    - Payroll reports
    - Or add custom: "December utility bills"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set a deadline">
    When do you actually need this? Be realistic but firm. "January 15" is better than "ASAP."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add context">
    Explain why you need it: "I need December statements to finish year-end close." Clients respond faster when they understand the reason.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send">
    Client receives an email with a secure upload link. They click, upload, done. No back-and-forth about where to send it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Tracking request status

Each request shows:

| Status | What it means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Sent** | Request delivered, waiting on client |
| **Viewed** | They opened it — they know you need something |
| **Partial** | Some documents uploaded, not all |
| **Complete** | Everything received |
| **Overdue** | Past deadline, still incomplete |

The "Viewed" status is useful. If they viewed it three days ago but haven't uploaded anything, you know they're procrastinating. Time to follow up.

### Automatic reminders

Set it and forget it:

1. Go to **Client → Settings → Communications**
2. Enable automatic reminders
3. Set frequency: every 3 days, every week, whatever works

Clients receive polite reminders until the request is complete. You don't have to remember to follow up.

## The client portal

Your clients see a portal where they can:
- Read and respond to your messages
- Upload documents you've requested
- See their financial reports (what you share with them)
- View invoices if you bill through Pluvel
- Update their contact information

### Portal access

When you add a client, they get an email with a portal link. They set a password, and they're in.

If they forget their password or lose access, resend from **Client → Settings → Portal Access**.

## Message templates

Typing the same message to every client every month? Save it as a template.

### Create a template

1. Go to **Firm Settings → Templates → Messages**
2. Click **New Template**
3. Name it something useful: "Month-End Document Request"
4. Write the message
5. Use variables for personalization:
   - `{{client_name}}` — Their company name
   - `{{month}}` — Current month
   - `{{due_date}}` — The deadline you'll set

### Using templates

1. Start a new message or document request
2. Click **Use Template**
3. Select your template
4. Customize if needed
5. Send

Templates worth having:
- Month-end document request
- Year-end preparation checklist
- Missing receipt inquiry
- Quarterly review scheduling
- New client welcome message

## Email integration

### Outgoing messages

Messages sent from Pluvel:
- Come from your firm's email domain (if you've set up white-label)
- Include your branding
- Link back to the client portal

Clients see emails that look like they're from you, not from some software they've never heard of.

### Client replies

When clients reply to an email:
- Their response appears in Pluvel
- You get a notification
- Your team can see the full thread

No more digging through your inbox to find that reply from two weeks ago.

## Communication history

Everything is saved:
- Messages (sent and received)
- Document requests (with responses)
- Shared reports
- Portal activity (what they looked at)

Search by date, type, or content. When a client asks "did I send you that?" you can pull up the answer in seconds.

<Info>
Communication history is retained for 7 years. Compliance requires it. You can export it if needed.

## Making communication work

**Be specific.** "Please send documents" gets ignored. "Please upload your December bank statement by January 10" gets results.

**Set real deadlines.** "ASAP" means nothing. A date means something.

**Use templates.** Consistency looks professional and saves time.

**Follow up on viewed requests.** If they've seen it, they can upload. A gentle nudge helps.

**Keep communication in Pluvel.** When you email outside the system, you lose the audit trail and the tracking. Keep it in one place.
