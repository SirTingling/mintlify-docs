When you manage multiple clients, fast switching is essential. Pluvel makes it easy to move between clients without losing your place.

## Client switcher

Access the client switcher from anywhere:

### Keyboard shortcut

Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) to open the quick switcher.

Type the client name and press Enter to jump directly to them.

### Sidebar switcher

Click the current client name in the sidebar to see a dropdown of all your clients.

### Top bar

The top bar shows the current client. Click to switch.

## Quick switcher features

The quick switcher (`Cmd+K`) does more than switch clients:

| Type | Search for |
|------|------------|
| Clients | Client name, contact, or EIN |
| Pages | "transactions", "reports", "reconcile" |
| Actions | "add transaction", "create invoice" |
| Help | "how to reconcile" |

### Recent clients

Your 5 most recently accessed clients appear at the top for quick access.

### Favorites

Star frequently-used clients to keep them pinned:
1. Click the star next to a client name
2. Starred clients appear in a Favorites section

## Context preservation

When you switch clients, Pluvel remembers:

- Your last position in each client
- Open tabs and panels
- Applied filters
- Work in progress (unsaved changes are preserved)

This means you can:
1. Open transactions in Client A
2. Switch to Client B to check something
3. Switch back — your transaction view is still there

## Multi-tab workflow

Open multiple clients in separate browser tabs:

1. Right-click on a client
2. Select "Open in New Tab"
3. Each tab maintains its own context

<Tip>
Use browser tab groups to organize clients by engagement type or review status.
</Tip>

## Side-by-side comparison

Compare two clients without switching:

1. Open Split View from the View menu
2. Select clients for left and right panels
3. Navigate each panel independently

Useful for:
- Comparing chart of accounts
- Reviewing similar transactions
- Checking consistent categorization

## Keyboard navigation

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+K` | Quick switcher |
| `Cmd+[` | Previous client |
| `Cmd+]` | Next client |
| `Cmd+1-9` | Jump to favorited client |
| `Esc` | Close switcher |

## Mobile switching

On mobile:
1. Tap the menu icon
2. Tap current client name
3. Select new client from the list

## Recent activity

See what you were last doing in each client:

1. Open the client switcher
2. Each client shows last activity
3. Click to resume where you left off

Example: "Transactions - 2 hours ago"

<Card
  title="Client permissions"
  icon="lock"
  href="/accountants/clients/permissions"
>
  Control what clients can see and do.
</Card>
